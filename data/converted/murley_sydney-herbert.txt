*An Outfit year ran from 1 June to 31 May

As a boy of 15 S.H. Murley was apprenticed to the London fur trade firm of Blatspiel, Stamp & Heacock. He was employed by them from 1900 to

1909 and then by the auction house of A. & W. Nesbitt from 1909 to 1920. He left Nesbitt's to start his own business and was for some years a

partner in Monjo, Murley & Hennessey, New York and London fur commission house.

He then went into business for himself under the name of S.H. Murley & Co. Ltd. At 24 Garlick Hill and is said to have been one of the first brokers

to import large shipments of S.W. African Persian Lamb.

S.H. Murley & Co. Ltd. Went into voluntary liquidation as of January 1st, 1935, at which date Murley became the General Manager of C.M.

Lampson & Co. Ltd.. Lampson's was an old established London firm, which became a subsidiary of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1928. In 1935

Murley travelled to New York to assist with the organization of Lampson, Fraser & Huth, Inc., a new company formed by the amalgamation of

Frederick Huth and Alfred Fraser Inc., the New York arm of Lampson's.

Murley returned to New York in 1940 as President of Lampson, Fraser & Huth Inc. and remained in this position until retirement in 1951. The

operations of the firm expanded greatly during Murley's Presidency and it played a leading role in the marketing of ranch-bred fox and mink.

Early in 1952 Murley became the Chairman of Robin of International Inc., a New York import/export company.
