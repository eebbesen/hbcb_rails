Budge deserted the HBC to work for the North West Company and then returned. He was haunted by the fear that the Canadians would assassinate him.

In 1806 he was sent with letters from Beaver River to Paint Creek in company with 2 Canadians. Hearing one of them say to the other, "Let us roast the

Englishman as he is lazy and will not assist in beating the path (i.e. walking first through the snow)", he feared for his life. He shot them while they slept; one

was killed and the other escaped. He was delivered to the custody of the Canadians.                                        B.239/a/112, fo. 28d-29d

The Governor and Committee declared themselves "exceedingly sorry" to hear of this incident, ordering the Council at York Factory "on no account keep him

in the Service."                                                                                                           A.6/17, fo. 107

Note: His parish is sometimes given as South Ronaldshay.
