                     JOHN STANGER (fl. 1867-1878)

The Governor and Committee at their meeting of 12 February 1867

appointed John Stanger of Stromness their agent in succession to Edward

Clouston. (A.1/78, p. 144) The Secretary wrote to him on 13 February

informing him of the appointment, which was to take effect as of 1 March

1867.  (A.5/32, p. 145) Stanger wrote on 16 February accepting the

appointment (A.10/69, fo. 341). [Clouston's letter of the same date is fo.

335.] On 5 March the Secretary sent Stanger a long letter outlining his

duties as Agent. (A.5/32, pp.163-165).

The last letter apparently written to Stanger was on 4 December 1878.

(A.5/43, fo. 560) Stanger died at Stromness on 20 December 1878.

(A.64/38, fo. 23d.)
