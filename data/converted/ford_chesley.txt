·  It is likely that Chesley Ford served with the Company beyond the term of this contract [a reference to him was located in RG2/50/2 (Officers and  Servants' Ledger,

   1925-1932) documenting the interest-bearing accounts that the Company maintained for Ford and other employees], but no further records appear      to have survived in

   the archives which chronicle Ford's career.
