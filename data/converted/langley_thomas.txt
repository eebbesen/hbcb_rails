Fort Langley (established 1827) was named after Thomas Langley, member of the Hudson's Bay Company Governing Committee at that time (HBC

Arch. D.4/6, fo.5d)

Thomas Langley became a stockholder of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1797 when he received the stock of his deceased brother, Nicholas.

(A.42/2,fos.48d). Langley became a member of the Committee of the Company in 1807, a position which he held until his death on 5 August 1829

(HBC Archives, A.1/56,fo.92d). In his will, dated 31 May 1826, with codicil dated 15 July 1829, Thomas Langley is described as 'heretofore of

London and Long Ditton, now of Southborough in the parish of Kingston, Surrey'. Langley's will, which is at Somerset House, was proved in the

Prerogative Court of Canterbury on 11 August 1829. We regret that we do not know Langley's date or place of birth.

Nicholas Langley, elder brother of Thomas, died in 1783 at Lymington, Hampshire. His will, dated 21 September 1782, with codicils dated 15

October 1781 and 20 September 1783, was proved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury on 21 October 1783 (HBC Archives, A.44/1,p.88). In his

will, which can be seen at Somerset House, Langley is described as 'late of East sheen'.
