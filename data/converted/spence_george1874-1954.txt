The extant formal documentation of George Spence's career covers only the years 1912 to 1931.

The following letter from Hugh Conn, Nelson River District Manager, to the Fur Trade Commissioner,

10 June 1931, describes his career in more detail:

...George Spence, who has given the Company very faithful service as guide, voyageur, pilot and Outpost Manager

for over forty years, thirty-eight of which have been on contract.*

George is one of the old type of servant to whom the wish of the Officer in Charge was law; his own comfort or

convenience was not taken into consideration when a volunteer was asked to undertake any difficult or dangerous

trip. Dr. Milne and others of the older retired officers who served during the past forty years at York Factory could

vouch for the exceptionally efficient and faithful service rendered by George on all occasions.                        RG2/37/180

*None of his contracts survives. According to a note, he signed them in Cree.                                          RG3/40C/2

Family:

He was married with a family of nine (RG3/40A/1 & 40C/2). His pension file (RG2/37/180) refers to a son, Alex,

and his son-in-law, J. Bignell, the game warden at York Factory, with whom he mostly lived during his old age.

He had a brother in Churchill whom he visited in the summer.
