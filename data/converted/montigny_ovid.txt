From Warner and Munnick, Catholic Church Records of the Pacific Northwest, Vancouver I and II, and Stellamaris

Mission, French Prairie Press, St. Paul OR, 1972, p.A-58:

An Ovide Montigny was a clerk on the Tonquin in the Pacific Fur Company. He was mentioned by Franchère as occupied

at Astoria in trading and various other errands; he narrowly missed the destruction of the Tonquin, having begged off from

sailing north with her because of his proneness to sea-sickness.
