John Dugald Cameron was the son of Scottish immigrants who settled at Schenectady, New York, and

removed to Canada at the time of the American Revolution. He was born in Canada about 1777 and was a

younger brother of Duncan Cameron. He entered the service of the North West Company after 1790, and was a

clerk in the Nipigon department for many years. In 1811 he took charge of the Lake Winnipeg department, and

in 1813 he was made a partner of the North West Company. He took no very active part in the Red River

Colony disturbances and 1815 wrote on the back of the handbill announcing the treaty of peace of Ghent,

"Peace all over the world except at R.R." He was in the Winnipeg department in 1816 and then probably went

on furlough for a year. In 1819-20 he was in the Ile-à-la-Crosse department at Green Lake in opposition to J.S.

McFarlane. By the coalition of the two companies in 1821, he became a Chief Factor in charge of the Columbia

district and remained there until 1824. From 1824 until 1838 he was in charge of the Lac la Pluie district with

headquarters at Lac la Pluie. In 1830 he renamed the post Fort Frances, in honour of Governor Simpsons wife.

From 1832 to 1834 his headquarters were at Fort Alexander (Bas de la Rivire), and in 1835 he was on

furlough. In 1836 he was placed in charge of the Lake Superior districts, and in 1839 he was appointed to the

Lake Huron district, where he remained at La Cloche until 1844. He was granted two years furlough

preparatory to his retirement on June 1, 1846. He settled at Grafton, Ontario, with his Indian wife and family,

and died on March 30, 1857. Besides the letters from Cameron continued in Glazerbrook, The Hargrave

Correspondence, a series of letters to Simpson is preserved in the Hudsons Bay Companys archives. Simpson

in his Character Book (1832) described him as "Strictly correct in all his conduct and dealings, and possess

much influence over the Natives: Speaks Sealteaux well, and is one of our best Indian Traders; but in other

respects not a man of business; nor well Educated, yet possesses a good deal of general information having read

almost every book that ever came within his reach." (taken from The Publications of The Champlain Society,
