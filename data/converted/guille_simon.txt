Family

From Warner & Munnick, Catholic Church Records of the Pacific Northwest:Vancouver, Volumes I and II,

and Stellamaris Mission (1992):

Simon Gill [sic], son of Thomas Gill and of Catherine Basin, native of St. François, Montréal, married

Marie Aÿhaélis of the Tsegalis nation, on 20 October 1845. The `20' should probably read' 28', as

Marie was baptized on 28 October 1845, aged 23. Their son, also called Simon, was baptized on

7 November 1845, the day of his birth. Marie was buried on 4 July 1846, having died the previous day.

Simon was re-married, on 2 January 1849, to Marie, the daughter of Etienne Pepin of the parish of Masca,

diocese of Montréal, and a woman of the tribe of the Mascoyennes. These ceremonies were all performed

at Fort Vancouver.
