Appointments & Service

Outfit Year*            Position:                          Post:                                           District:  HBCA Reference:

*An Outfit year ran from 1 June to 31 May

After searching our surviving North West Company records I am unable to determine when Mr. Boucher entered that Company's service.

However, I did trace his contract with the Hudson's Bay Company dated February 23, 1822. (HBC arch. A 32/22, fo.63). The servants' Accounts for this

period described him as a Native (ie. born in Rupert's Land), serving in the capacity of Interpreter in the New Caledonia District. (HBC Arch. B.239/g1,

fo.35). In 1830 he is noted as being 41 years of age (HBC Arch. B.223/a/2, fo.6)

He served the duration of his career in this capacity and in the district until his death at Fort St. James on August 26, 1849.

(HBC Arch. B.239/g/2-29; B1 88/a/20, fo.84)
