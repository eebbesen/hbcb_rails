Bradbury left permanent employment with the HBC in Feb. 1945, when he went home on the death of his father,

Steve Bradbury of the HBC. From June 1945 to 1950 he was a seasonal employee at Blanc Sablon (briefly at

St. Augustine in the fall of 1950). From 1951 to 1959 he was employed aboard M.V. Rupertsland, for most of the time

as bosun.

He married Ellen Irene Mercer, daughter of Kenneth Mercer of Bay Roberts, March 18th, 1946.

Bradbury was described in Sept. 1941 as "a cheerful, robust and very willing lad. He has made very good progress

with Mr Riddell who speaks highly of him. Bradbury is quite happy at Belcher but he should be transferred next

Outfit for more experience. He is at home anywhere on the sea coast and am confident he will eventually prove to be

a very good Eskimo trader." (M. Cowan)
