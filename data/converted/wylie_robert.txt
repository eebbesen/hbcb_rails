Robert Wylie, formerly of the parish of Burray, Orkney, signed a contract to service in the capacity of Labourer for a term of five years on the 6

November 1867. (HBC Archives, A.32/59, fo.195).

A second contract was signed on the 14 September 1868, this time in the capacity of a Slooper (skipper for a local sailing craft), and Sawyer etc. for

a term of five years. (Ibid, fo,197).

It appears that Robert Wylie did not complete the terms of his contracts. He served in the capacity of Slooper between 1867-1869 and returned to

Europe afterwards. (HBC Archives B.239/g/109, fo.36; B.239/g/113,fo.63).
