Volumes I, II and III, Portland, 1979, pp. A-19-20:

Basile Courville "was born [ca. 1822] in New York State near the Canadian border, apparently a mixed-blood.                     ARCHIVES

He came West in 1839, perhaps in the employ of the fur trade, and lived around St. Louis, Oregon, for some years.               WINNIPEG

In 1851 he married Marianne Klickatat, the widow of Honore King, who had died unrecorded at some time between

1848 and 1851, possibly in the gold fields. Courville and his wife went to the South Umpqua River of Douglas County

to make their home..." They had at least three sons - Louis (1853), Edouard (1858) and Gilbert (1861).
