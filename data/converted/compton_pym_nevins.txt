*An Outfit year ran from 1 June to 31 May

Pym NeVins Compton entered the service of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1858 as a clerk at 100 per annum. According to his contract, signed

that same year, he was from Tottenham, Middlesex.(1) He is listed in the Abstracts of Servants' Accounts for 1858-1862 as being at Fort Simpson

(Nass) and for 1862-1863 aboard the steamer Labouchere,(2) a Hudson's Bay Company supply ship plying the North Pacific Coast. In 1863 he was

placed in charge of Fort Rupert.(3) Unfortunately little else is known of this last posting since few Fort Rupert records have survived in the

Hudson's Bay Company Archives. In 1866 Compton, his wife, and a child under two, boarded the Prince of Wales for England.(4) In 1867 he

corresponded with the Company regarding a possible re-engagement, but no terms were agreed.(5)

The last address so far found for him was West Ham, London. (6)

According to Captain John T. Walbran, British Columbia Coast Names, (Ottawa, 1909) , Mr. Compton was in California sometime later and died in

Victoria in 1879. This information has not been confirmed from the Hudson's Bay Company Archives. However, the Bancroft Library, University

of California, Berkley, has a manuscript entitled "Forts and Fort Life in New Caledonia under Hudson's Bay Company Regime" by

a P. N. Compton. This is presumably Pym Nevins Compton and undoubtedly would yield additional biographical details.
