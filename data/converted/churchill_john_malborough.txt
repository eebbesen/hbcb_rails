John Churchill was born in Musbury, Devonshire, the son of Winston Churchill of Glanville Wotton, Dorset. He went to St. Paul's school from 1663

to 1665. At age 15 he became page of honour to the duke of York. In 1667 he received a commission in the Guards and left England for service at

Tangier, and returned to England in 1670. Eight years later he married Sarah Jennings, the favourite attendant on the Princess Anne, younger

daughter of the Duke of York.

He became third Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company on the resignation of H.R.R. James, Duke of York in 1685.

For his service to the new monarch, John Churchill was made in May 1685 Baron Churchill of Sandrige in Hertfordshire. When the Duke of

Monmouth attempted his ill-fated enterprise in the western countries the second position in command of the king's army was bestowed on Lord

Churchill and in July 1685 he was raised to the rank of Major-General. Through his energy at the battle of Sedgemoor on July 6, 1685, the Kings's

side was victorious. Because of the King's religious policies Churchill was one of the first to send overtures to Prince William of Orange. In 1688 he

switched his allegiance to Prince William. For his brilliant exploits during the War of the Spanish Succession he was created Duke of Malborough in

December 1702.

He died at Cranbourn Lodge, near Windsor, on June 16, 1722.
