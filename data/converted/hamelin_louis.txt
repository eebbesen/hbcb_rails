Prior to entering the service of the HBC Hamelin was a trader on his own account.                             B.115/e/8, fo. 3

In the Winter Arrangements for 1888 & 1889, he is listed as "Indian Trader

& Runner", posted "on the Lake [Lesser Slave Lake?]".                                                         B.115/f/1, fo.5

In 1891 he was in charge of Battle River.                                                                     B.115/f/1,fo.6;B.115/e/12,fo.13

In 1896 & 1897 he was in charge of Sturgeon Lake.                                                             D.38/30,fo.7; B.115/e/16,fo. 12

What posts he was at in 1890 and 1892-1895 have not been established.

Hamelin's abilities as an Indian trader are frequently mentioned in the records. He was also praised for his

"energetic action" in the spring of 1897 when he saved the Company's property from prairie fires "while

9 horses and other property of his own were destroyed." Unfortunately, his problems with alcohol are also

mentioned; as a result he was not re-hired after 1897.                                                        B.115/e/16,fo.13

In 1891 Hamelin was described as "about 45 years of age". (B.115/e/12,fo.13) He was probably the Louis

Hamelin who was born in St. Vital, Manitoba in 1850, the son of Salomon Hamelin (1810-1893) and the

grandson of Jacques Hamelin (1772-1868). His wife was Marie McGillis (m. 1874). For information on the

Hamelin family, see Gail Morin, Métis families: A Genealogical Compendium (1996), pp. 488-495.
