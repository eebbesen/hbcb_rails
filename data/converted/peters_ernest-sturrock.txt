Ernest Sturrock Peters entered the Hudson's Bay Company service in September, 1888 as an Apprentice Clerk at MacLeod Lake. During 1893-1894 he left the

employ of the H.B.Co. and was referred to in a letter from A.C. Murray to Tibbet at Stuart Lake. Mr. Peters at that time had left Victoria and had written an article

in a Tacoma newspaper about the wild life he had led among "...the Siccanee Indians, Grizzly Bears and cariboo." (B.119/c/1 fo. 53).

He came back into service briefly, worked as a Freeman and apparently returned to England for a short time in 1898. When he returned to the Quesnell area, he was

employed as a Clerk for a mining company before rejoining the H.B.Co.

Mr. Peters had a wife and at least four children. A daughter "Bessie" died 05 June 1904, age 8. She was buried at the Company's cemetery at Fraser Lake and a

tombstone was erected (B.119/c/1 fo. 9). No other names were mentioned, but an account record indicated that a boy's jacket was purchased (B.226/b/53.3a).

Mr. Peters began some experimental farming as early as 1890, and on 08 February 1906 received a Diploma from the Secretary of the Dominion Exhibition, New

Westminster for the exhibit of grain sent to the Exhibition (B.226/b/53.3G).

Mr. Peters was a very community-minded person. He was instrumental in getting a ferry across the Nechaco River and in submitting a petition regarding a wagon

road from Quesnell to Fraser Lake (B.226/b/53.3S). He was also the Secretary of the Fraser Lake Settlers Association and instrumental in requesting a school at

Fraser Lake (B.226/b/53.3G).

In correspondence from E.S. Peters to J. Thomson (20 April 1909), he mentioned a relative, S.G. Ridge and wife, coming out to take over his ranch (B.226/b/53.3S p.233).

E.S. Peters worked at Fraser Lake Post from 1900-1910, when he moved his family to his ranch and once more became a Freeman. He is noted as such until 1913, after which date

his name does not appear in the H.B.Co. documents.
