He was an American trapper who was a member of Peter Skene Ogden's Snake Country expeditions in the last years of his life. There are several

references to him in Glyndwr Williams, ed., Peter Skene Ogden's Snake Country Journals 1827-28 and 1828-29, Hudson's Bay Record Society, Vol.

XXVIII (1971).

Munnick & Warner, Catholic Church Records of the Pacific Northwest: St. Paul, Oregon 1839-1898 (Portland, 1979), gives the following

information about him (p. A-38):

Goodrich (Gadritche, Gaudritche)

Goodrich, given name not known, but probably either John, Silas, or Bache was one of the American trappers who so plagued Peter Skene Ogden in

the Snake River country in the late 1820's....On the return of the brigade Ogden picked up a wounded Frenchman and an Indian woman carrying a

small baby, all near starvation. They had escaped from a Blackfoot massacre beyond the Rockies and were trying to reach Vancouver or some other

Hudson's Bay post. Goodrich took the woman, whom he named Nancy, as his wife. He was drowned a year or two later at The Dalles, and was

buried on the bench[sic] above the town, under an oak tree. His daughter Susanne [but a few days old when her father drowned] married Pierre

Pepin, dit LaChance; his widow Nancy married Jean Baptiste Dobin. Dobin died in the gold fields in 1849 and his wife, who had accompanied him,

died at St. Paul shortly after her return in 1850.

Nancy is sometimes called Nancy Twinishe of Wenaske. (Search File, "Goodrich, John")
