*An Outfit year ran from 1 June to 31 May

Edward Clouston of Stromness joined the service of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1779 and was at first

employed as servant to Edward Jarvis, the chief at Moose Factory. When Jarvis assumed charge of Albany in

1782, Clouston accompanied him.

Clouston renewed his contract in 1783 in the capacity of "Writer" (i.e. clerk) in the Moose Factory district,

and in 1784 he was referred to as "Writer and Inland Trader at Abitibi", a new post constructed by Philip

Turner. When Turnor abandoned this post in the spring of 1785, Clouston moved with him to establish

Frederick House.

In December, 1785, Clouston arrived at Albany, where he took over the duties of writer and steward. He

was in charge of Osnaburgh House during part of the winter of 1787-88 whilst the master was absent. He

continued to serve in the Albany district in subordinate positions, but in seasons 1792-93 and 1793-94 he was

master in charge of Cat Lake post. He had charge of Portage de l'Isle, 1794-95; established Point au Foutre,

1795-96: established a post probably near the mouth of Manitogan River, 1796-97; and had charge of

Osnaburgh House, 1797-98. He retired from the Company's service in 1798 and returned to the Orkneys. He

was not at any time listed in the Company's books as a 'governor' or 'chief factor'.
