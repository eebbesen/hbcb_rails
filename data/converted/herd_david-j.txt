Letters to and from: Series A.5 and A.10

Herd was master of the Prince Rupert when R.M. Ballantyne sailed to York Factory in 1841. There are several passages

in Ballantyne's Hudson Bay describing him, e.g. ` ...thin, middle-sized, off-hand man; thoroughly acquainted with his

profession; good-humoured and gruff by turns; and he always spoke with the air of an oracle." (p.20) Ballantyne records

Herd as having said he had been at sea "these fifteen years" (p.22). At one time he had been in the Mediterranean

"in Lord P_____'s yacht" (p.22)             This may have been Algernon Percy, Lord Prudhoe (1792-1865), later the Duke of                ARCHIVES

Northumberland. He was a naval officer and also an amateur Egyptologist of some note.        DNB, Vol. XV                                 WINNIPEG
