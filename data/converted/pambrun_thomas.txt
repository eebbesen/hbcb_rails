Biographical outline from Catholic Church Records of the Pacific Northwest: Vancouver I & II, Stellamaris Mission reads:

"Like all the family, Thomas was musically gifted." He is remembered by the family as "the only one who inherited the curls of both

his father and his mother". He, too, worked on the Beaverhead Ranch of Richard Grant in Montana, "where all the hands lived in

elkskin lodges". His first was a Shoshone, whose sons by an earlier marriage, Francis and John, went by the Pambrun name;

his second wife was Jane Tenday, daughter of the wise and moderate Chief Tenday of the Lemhi Tribe. (A.63)
