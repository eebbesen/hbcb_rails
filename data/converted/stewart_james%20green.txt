*An Outfit year ran from 1 June to 31 May

James Green Stewart, Junior, entered the H.B.C. service as an apprentice clerk about 1881, being employed during the next five years in the Swan

River District, where he was appointed to Fort Ellice for the year 1882-83, and afterwards to the charge of Nut Lake during 1883-85.

It seems that he retired from the service in 1886, but in 1896 he re-entered the employ of the H.B.C. in the capacity of clerk, being then appointed

to the Lake Winnipeg District until 1897, and afterwards to the Norway House District until 1900, where he was in charge of the post at Berens

River. It appears that he again left the service in or about 1901 until 1904, afterwards serving once more as a clerk in the newly established Keewatin

District until the latter part of 1905. (Search file)
