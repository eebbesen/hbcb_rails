John Kipling (age unknown), who joined the Hudson's Bay Company in 1810 as a labourer, was always described as a native of Hudson's Bay. He

was employed in the Red River area until he left the Company's employment on 13 April 1821. (1) It is known that he was at Fort Dauphin during

outfit 1819-20 acting as interpreter, but that he was unable to leave the house as he was still suffering from the effects of a Fall from a horse, which

had occurred about five years earlier at the Company's post of `Portage des Prairies'. His brother George, a youth of about 14 or 15 years of age,

was also at Fort Dauphin during season 1819-20. (2)
