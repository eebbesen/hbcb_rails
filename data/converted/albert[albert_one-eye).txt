Albert (?1824-1849). Albert One-Eye or Albert as he was generally known, was an Eskimo "liked by every-one for his good temper, lively

disposition and great activity", from the east coast of James Bay. He was born about 1824. In 1842 he was taken to Moose Factory, where he

entered into a contract to serve the Hudson's Bay Company as a labourer. He worked in the Rupert River and Fort George districts until 1848, when

he was attached to Sir John Richardson's expedition in search of Sir John Franklin. Albert travelled to the Mackenzie River district by way of

Moose Factory, Michipicoten and Cumberland House. He was a member of Dr. John Rae's boat party which Richardson had instructed to descend

the Coppermine River in the summer of 1849 to continue the search for Franklin, and it was during the course of this journey ( on August 24) that he

was accidentally drowned at the Bloody Fall.
