*Middle position in canoe or boat, often used interchangeably with labourer. When he signed his contract

in May 1856, he was to "receive a gratuity of £3 pr. an., in the event of his acting and giving satisfaction

as a fisherman."                                                                                                          B.239/u/2, #733

According to Michael Payne, "Fort Churchill, 1821-1900: An Outpost Community in the Fur Trade",

Manitoba History, Autumn 1990, pp. 2-15, Grey and his wife [not identified] had four children:

Nancy (m. George Oman), Mary (m. (1) John Grout (2) Norman Marten (3) George McPherson),

Samuel and William. At some places in the article Payne appears to confuse this Samuel Grey with another

Churchill employee of the same name, an Englishman who died in 1887.

His death was recorded in the Churchill post journal:                                                                     ARCHIVES

Sunday, 2 April 1922: Beautiful day...Mr Mitchell was called to see Sam Gray who had taken ill early in                   WINNIPEG

the morning and was showing signs of failing. Mr Mitchell went down and did his best to revive him, but

unfortunately his efforts were of no avail, and Sam died a little after noon. He was the oldest inhabitant here

being about 80 years of age. He was also a pensioner having served a term of forty five years in the Company's

employ. Just recently he was decorated with a long service gold medal and three bars, and up to the time of his

death was a very active man. He was a faithful servant of the Company and was highly esteemed by all the officers

whom he had the pleasure to work under. His boyhood days were spent in Orkney Islands after which he was taken

to this country at the age of 10. Thus passes another character of the "old times" and with him a great stock of country

lore.  He was a recognized authority of country lore, and had an inexhaustible stock of old time customs and anecdotes

which one could never tire of hearing. His passing is deeply regretted by all who had the pleasure of knowing him.

He leaves a widow and married son. Funeral tomorrow.

3 April: Beautiful day mild. All hands attended the burial of Sam Gray.                                                   B.42/a/205,      p.  108
