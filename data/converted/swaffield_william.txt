Career after Labrador

In the fall of 1918, Swaffield took his first furlough since 1895/96. He wrote to James Thompson on 15 Dec. 1918 to state that he wished to live in a

place where his children could be "properly educated". He had been offered a partnership in "a raw fur purchasing venture" which would mean

living in Montreal. "However, to date I have not given the offer serious consideration preferring (if the prospective inducement is sufficiently

promising) to remain in the employ of the Company where I have practically spent my whole working life" (A.12/FT 340/3, fo.171 He remained on

furlough until June 1920. In July 1920 he returned to the Fur Trade Department as Warehouse Superintendent for the Eastern Buying Agency,

Montreal. On 16 Feb. 1924, he was transferred to the Montreal Buying Office of the wholesale Department, continuing to work in the McGill Street

warehouse. Owing to poor health, re retired on pension as of 31 December 1926 and died in Montreal on 12 February 1952. (A.92/17/128, fo.77;

In 1893 Swaffield was reported as finding "the life on the Coast too lonesome & monotonous" (D.38/17, fo.1)                                      ARCHIVES

He returned to England on furlough from fall 1895 to summer 1896 for the purpose of getting married. (A.12/FT 340/5/2)                           WINNIPEG

When he signed his new contract on 26 February 1896 his address is given as 2, Alexander Rerrace, Christchurch Road,

East Boscombe, Bournemouth. (A.32/55, fo.240)

His wife predeceased him on 30 November 1942. (RG2/37/187) They had six sons and two daughters; Wilfred, Stewart, Bert, Alick, Sidney,

Harold, Millie and Georgina. (J.S.C. Watt, "Labrador Years", The Beaver, June 1937, p.22.) He was survived by five sons and two daughters.

June 1917 and Alexander Burge, b. 19 Nov. 1904, entered service 21 July 1924. (RG3/40C/1)

Comments on Swaffield refer not only to his business zeal and competence but to his ability to get on with everyone with whom he had dealings -

planters, Inuit and Innu. (See D.38/6b, fo.153d.; D.38/7, p.291; D.38/55, p.143; D.38/17, passim) In his article "Labrador Years", pp. 22-23,

Jimmy Watt remembered:

Mr. Swaffield had the general direction of all the hurry and confusion {at Cartwright} and handled it easily. He always had time to chat with a

customer, and could even listen to Phoebe Marten discoursing on "Fox{e}'s Book of Martyrs" without turning a hair.
