*An Outfit year ran from 1 June to 31 May

    He was first known as John Kipling, Junior, but from about 1810 onwards he was called either John Ram Kipling, or Ram John Kipling,

presumably to distinguish him from the Young John Kipling who joined the Hudson's Bay Company in that year.(1)

    John Ram Kipling, a native of Rupert's Land, joined the Hudson's Bay Company in 1798 (2) when he was about 17 years of age. (3) He was

employed first as a labourer and later as a steersman inland from Albany Factory. He was stationed at Pembina during 1814-15; at Turtle, River,

where he was considered a good interpreter, during 1815-16; and at the Forks of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers during seasons 1817-18 and 1818-

19. He continued to serve in the Red River area until he left the Company's employ in 1821.(4)
