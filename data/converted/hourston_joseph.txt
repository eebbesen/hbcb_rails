6 Jan. 1885 H. Belanger made the following report from Cumberland House:

Joseph Hourston, Clerk, entered the service some 13 years ago as labourer and remained in this district all the time. Finding he was a very intelligent

man I had him promoted at the end of his first contract to the position of Postman. During these 13 years he has been one of the most useful men in

my district. He had evidently received a fair education which he kept up and improved and also learned the Cree language and is now capable of

taking charge of any of the outposts in the district & when necessary I have frequently sent him in temporary charge. I would willingly have him in

charge of a post now but for the fact that he is much more useful here. Apart from his duties as shopman, he willingly performed any work required

either as a carpenter, Boatbuilder, Blacksmith or in fact any thing he can do (he is very ingenious) thus saving the expense of keeping tradesmen ...
