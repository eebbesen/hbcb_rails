Prince Rupert, Count Palatine of the Rhine and Duke of Bavaria (1619-1682), third son of the elector palatine of Bohemia, Frederick V., and of

Elizabeth daughter of James 1 of England, was born at Prague on 17 December 1619. He spent his boyhood in France and in 1636 paid his first visit

to England. He played a dominant part in the Civil War from 1642 to 1646. From 1654 to 1660o he lived in Germany. At the Restoration he settled

in England and received from his cousins, King Charles 11, and annuity. He was Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company from 1670 until his death
