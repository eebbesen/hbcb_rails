District Inspector's/Manager's Annual Reports consistently praised Aldous's competency and desirability as a post manager

for the Company:

1916 Annual Report for Lake Superior District, White Dog Post (A.74/45):

"The present results, which I expect will be improved upon, for Outfit 1916 reflect great credit on the Manager, F. H. Aldous,

who, while quite a junior in the Service, has proved himself a better Trader than his predecessors with their many years

experience; being very painstaking and conscientious in carrying out my instructions regarding the trade."

1917 Annual Report for Lake Superior District, White Dog Post (A.74/47):

"The Post is under the charge of Mr. F. H. Aldous of whose integrity and industry I cannot speak too highly."

1925 Annual Report for Lake Superior District, Lac Seul Post (A.74/38):

"...age 53 years, 14 years' service. Is a very good bookkeeper, well experienced in the Indian fur trading. Very careful

to keep down expenses around the post. Careful on Indian advances. Not suitable for railway line post work. Salary

$90.00 per month..."

1929 Annual Report for Superior-Huron District, Lac Seul Post, by John Bartleman (A.74/42-7, fo. 18):
