From David Learmonth, "To Labrador by Sail", The Beaver, April/May 1998 [memoir of voyage in Pelican, 1904], p.36:

The Pelican performed best with sail, and George F. Lovegrove, the first mate, was a master at obtaining the maximum

advantage from the prevailing winds, taking inordinate pride in his skill. When on deck, his eyes were ever on the sails,                             ARCHIVES

and at the slightest shift in the wind his men were ordered into action.                                                                              WINNIPEG

Lovegrove was an odd physical specimen, short of stature, but with the huge, broad shoulders and the great, powerful

arms of a much larger man. His face was that of the traditional Uncle Sam, chin whiskers and all, but his voice was

pure Cockney.
