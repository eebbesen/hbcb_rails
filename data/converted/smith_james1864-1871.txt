"Clandeboye Old Timer Passes Away":

An old-time Clandeboye resident and former Hudson's Bay Company employee passed away on July 23 [1917]

in the person of James Smith. Death took place suddenly at deceased's farm at Clandeboye, at the age of 77.

A widow , five daughters, five sons, and many granchildren are the survivors.

Mr Smith was one of the first settlers in his district and was for many years in the employment of the Hudson's Bay

Company in the Athabasca territory.

Interment took place at St. Louis Cemetery, Clandeboye.

He may have been the James Smith who was baptized at St. Peter's, Red River on August 8th, 1841,

the son of John James Smith and Nancy Favel.                                                                         Anglican Parish Registers Data
