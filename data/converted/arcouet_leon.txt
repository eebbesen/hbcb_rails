Extract from letter, John McLoughlin, Chief Factor to the Governor and Committee

of the Hudson's Bay Company in London, dated [Fort] Vancouver 2nd August 1843:

".... Since I last wrote you, the Brigade has been to this place, and in going up,

one of the Boats, I am sorry to say, was swamped in a whirlpool [at the Dalles

of the Columbia], most of the property in her lost, and one of the men, named

[Leon] Arcouet, drowned --- and another, Swanson, his setting pole slipped, he

fell out of the boat into the water, and never appeared again".      (A.11/70, fo. 33)
