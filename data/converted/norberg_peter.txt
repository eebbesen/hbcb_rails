Norberg, Peter (? ­ 1933). Described as "one of the north's true adventurers". He worked at everything from navigating and trading to trapping and

prospecting. He was employed by the Hudson's Bay Company in the 1920's operating ships and helping to establish some of the most northerly

trading posts on the islands of the Arctic Ocean. He helped to establish the post on King William Island and operated it from 1924-26. In 1933 he

left his camp near the headwaters of the Coppermine River to visit the Fort Hearne Post, and was never seen again although a search was made by his

son John and Corporal Wall, R.C.M.P. (Search File)
