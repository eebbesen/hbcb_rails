Bibliographic: "Sad Death of a White Man in an Indian Camp", Manitoulin Expositor, May 15, 1880. According to the article, Hill came over to

Canada, a well educated man to work as a clerk for the HBC. He served a three year contract and renewed for a further two years. Before the two

years were up, he met an Native woman at Serpent River that he wished to marry. He requested a discharge from the Hudson's Bay Company, as

well as his back pay. The HBC denied his request and instead transferred him to Fort William in the hopes he would forget his idea. He soon

deserted the HBC in order to marry the woman.
