Jacques L'Hirondelle (senior)

According to an entry in the index to E. Coues' New Light on the Early History of the Greater Northwest (New York, 1897.), Jacques L'Hirondelle

was a voyageur in Athabasca for the North West Company in 1804. There are so few records of the North West Company in the archives of the

Hudson's Bay Company that we are unable either to confirm or deny this statement.

The North West Company's Ledger (H.B.C. Arch. F.4/32) covering the period 1811-21 is in our archives, and on page 524 there is an account

under the name "Jacques L'Hirondelle". Since the account opens in 1811 with a balance of 1219 North West Livres carried forward from a previous

ledger (not in our archives), it is clear that L'Hirondelle had been employed by the North West Company previous to 1811. Wages were credited for

the years 1812-1818, after which time the remark "Free" was entered in pencil. So far we have been able to trace he was not employed by the

Hudson's Bay Company at any time under contract.

In his Le Mtis Canadian (Paris, 1945.), p.1012, Professor Marcel Giraud remarks:

                                                    "LA CLASSE DES HOMMES LIBRES.

....Certains Secteurs, bien fournis de ressources alimentaires, divinrent alors des points de concentration des hommes libres. Iles le sont rests

aujourd `hui. Ca fut le cas du district du Petit Iac des Esclaves, du Lac la Biche, de la rivire Castor (Beaver river), des plaines de la Saskatchewan et

de la rivire la Paix. De bonne heure on y relve, sur les listes des `homes libres', les noms des familles mtisses qui figurent aujourd'hui dans la

population de ces rgions lointaines, les Bellecourt, Gladu, L'hyrondelle...".

The Hudson's Bay Company document to which Professor Giraud refers is in the York Factory Miscellaneous Papers for 1838 (H.B.C. Arch.

B.239/z/10)* and is entitled: "Indian Population of Sundry Districts". It includes the "List of Population (Canadian Freemen & Descendants Half

Breeds) belonging to the Hble Hudsons Bay Company's Post of Lesser Slave Lake. Saskatchewan Dist. Outfit 1837/38" from which the following

Jacques L'Hirondelle (junior)

    All we know about this man is that he joined the service of Hudson's Bay Company as middleman at Edmonton House on May 21, 1832. His

contract was for two years and in the Northern Department Engagement Register (H.B.C. Arch. B.239/u/1, No.1132), he was recorded as being a

native of Lesser Slave Lake , twenty-five years of age at the time of his engagement. He went "Free Inland" at the expiry of his contract.

Joseph L'Hirondelle

    All we have discovered about Joseph L'Hirondelle is that he was a native of the Company's Saskatchewan District. He was engaged as a

fisherman at Edmonton House on May 7, 1855, and became free on June 1, 1857, at the expiry of his contract.

Baptiste L'Hirondelle

    Baptiste L'Hirondelle first joined the service of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1841 when he was twenty-three years of age. He was described

as a native of Lesser Slave Lake and entered into a contract for three years as a middleman. His contract was renewed from time to time and in 1855

he left the Company's service. The following extracts which mention Baptiste L'Hirondelle have been taken from the Edmonton House Journal for

1856-58 (H.B.C. Arch. B.60/a/29b):

1856
October 16   "...Jno: Cunningham arrived to day from Lac Ste.Anne,...

             Three freemen (Sowand, Marto L'Hyrondelle & Paulet Gladieu) came in with Jno:       Cummingham..."

                                                                                                                                             ARCHIVES

October 17   "...John Cunningham & the freeman left this morning for Lac Ste. Anne..."                                                       WINNIPEG

December 31  "...Kinnenawis & family arrived this evening from Fort Assiniboine..."

1857

January 7    "...Kinnenawis & his man (Bap. Hyrondelle) went off this morning to the plains..."

January 26   "...Kinnenawis & family with his man (L'Hyrondelle)

             took their departure this morning for Fort Assiniboine...".

As we have no Fort Assiniboine journals for this period we have been unable to follow the movement of Kinnenawis and L'Hirondelle any

further.

Baptiste L'Hirondelle appears to have re-joined the Company's service as a steersman in 1857 and to have continued in that capacity or as a

fisherman until he finally retired in 1870.

We have not found any information concerning the other sons of Jacques L'Hirondelle, senior, nor have we found any references to his two

daughters.
