Although Lamprant does not appear to be listed in the Abstracts of Servants Accounts other than for the years

1850-1863, his actual years of service were from 1840 to 1870. On 18 September 1902 Lamprant wrote from

Kamloops to the Company's London Office, claiming to have "been in the continuous employ of your Company

for the period of thirty years throughout British Columbia..." (A.10/160, fo. 441). His appeal for financial assistance

was forwarded to the Commissioner in Winnipeg (A.6/75, fo. 13), who replied on 13 March 1903 that he had learned

from enquiries that Lamprant had been an "Interpreter & Fur Buyer at Kamloops [Thompson River] from about 1840

to 1870 [and was] now 78 years of age, almost blind, in destitute circumstances and unable to earn a livelihood."                    (A.12/FT 334/1a, fo. 63)

According to Mary Balf, Kamloops: A History of the District up to 1914 (Kamloops Museum, third ed., 1989)

p. 124, Antoine Lampreau manned a fort at Barriere for the Hudson's Bay Company in the winters of 1851 and 1852.
