happened this morning the llth, by which Mr. Heddle lost his life. The Expedtn. Blacksmith in

examining a Gun belonging to the deceased, which was in want of some repair, and not being as he

affirms, aware of its being loaded it went off and melancholy to say, shot the man through the head.

He expired on the spot. This unfortunate accident has caused a universal regret for his death. He was

a very worthy honest Man, and one of the most interested that I have seen in the Coys. service.
