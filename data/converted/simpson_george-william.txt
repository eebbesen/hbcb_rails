George W. Simpson does not appear on the list of London employees after 1841. Though not employed by the Hudson's Bay Company, he appears to have had

connections with the Company probably through the sugar brokering firm of Scott, Simpson & Co. (formerly Simpson & Scott) which had business dealings with the

Hudson's Bay Company and in which he became a partner in 1854.  He appears to have moved to Montreal in 1857 or 1858.  His correspondence with Sir George

Simpson was concerned primarily with financial affairs. He is described as a 'near relative' of Sir George, but his exact relationship to the family has not been

determined. (A.5/14,16; A.10/36 - 2 October 1854, William Scott to Hudson's Bay Company; B.134/b/17, fos.72, 89, 114, 291 ,766, 793, 806, 829, 843B, 854; D.5,
