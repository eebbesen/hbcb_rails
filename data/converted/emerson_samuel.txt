James McDougall in his report on Northern Transport, March 1893:

Samuel Emerson, Engineer, 40 yrs of age, has been in the service 7 yrs. His wages

are $1000 per annum with clerk's allowance. He is an excellent mechanic as Engineer,

Boatbuilder and Carpenter. Besides being Engineer, he looks after the boat, laying

her up for the winter and keeping her in repair, for which his wages were increased,

saving the necessity of a permanent Captain. He is a valuable man and well worth

retaining.                                                                                                     D.25/17, fo. 322
