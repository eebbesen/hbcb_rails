*An Outfit year ran from 1 June to 31 May

Our records show that Albert E. Isherwood was employed by the Hudson's Bay Company from 1904 until 1908. In the summer of 1905 he took

command of the Company's vessel, the s.s. Wrigley, which was at that time being used for the Mackenzie River Transport, i.e., she travelled between

Fort Smith and Fort Simpson and the lower posts on the Mackenzie River during the summer, and was laid up at Willow River, near Fort Simpson

during the winter. Isherwood appears to have taken over command of the Wrigley at Fort Smith some time at the end of June or the beginning of

July, 1905. The Fort Simpson journal shows that he arrived at that post on July 14, 1905. He left on the same day on a voyage to the lower posts and

arrived back at fort Simpson on July 27. From July 28 until August 19 he was engaged on a trip to the lower posts, and returned to Fort Simpson on

August 24. He left again for Fort Smith on the same day, and arrived back at Simpson on September 18. The Wrigley was then laid up at Willow

River for the winter season, and the journal shows that Captain Isherwood wintered at Fort Simpson. Unfortunately the journal does not refer to his

wife or family, although it is possible that they were living with him at Fort Simpson.

Captain Isherwood remained in command of the Wrigley from 1905 until the end of outfit 1907-08, when he retired from the service  During the

summers of 1906 and 1907 he was engaged on the transport business between Fort Smith and Fort Simpson , and he spent the winter of 1906-07 at

Fort Simpson. His whereabouts during the winter of 1907-08 are not known.
