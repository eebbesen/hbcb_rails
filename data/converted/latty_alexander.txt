Notes: His name appears as Latty, Lattey, Lattie. The signature on his contract of 1830 is not clear enough to know

which spelling he preferred. His home parish appears as Kirkcaldy on his 1830 contract but as "Drone"

[perhaps Dron in Perthshire?} in the year of his retirement. (B.239/g/86). An Alexander Lattie, Jr., Native, is listed

as an apprentice carpenter at the Vancouver Depot in the late 1840s. (B.239/g/86, fo. 83)
