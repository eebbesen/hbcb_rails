Notes:

Miller was the author of at least 4 post journals but no position or title was specified for him in those journals: Red River Post post journal, 1797-

1801 (B.235/a/1 & B.235/a/2), Lac Du Bonnet post journal, 1807-1808 (B.103/a/1), Henley House post journal, 1808-1809 (B.86/a/60).

Although Miller was consistently hired on as a labourer he acted in higher capacities at various times. For instance, the remarks column of the 1797

Albany List of Servants (A.30/7, fol. 52d, line 94) for Miller states: "His _____ (?) have been mislaid come (or some?) years ago ~ his wages less

than he requested, beg to be referred (?) to Mr. Goodwin ~ a worthy faithful servant, when in charge of OH he acted well" and the remarks column of

the 1798 Albany List of Servants (A.30/8, fol. 8d, line 96) for Miller states: "Requests £25 for two years and 30 for one ~ deserves it ~ is in charge of

Brandon House ~ acted well there after Mr Jas Sutherlands Death ~"
