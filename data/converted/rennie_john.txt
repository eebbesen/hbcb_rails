*1875 listed as James Rennie but the first name is probably copied in error from the entry for James Rankin immediately above.

His career 1869-1874 is confirmed by the records of the General Registry of Shipping & Seamen (HBCA, E.188/59-74). His position in the 1873 Greenland

voyage is given as boatsteerer & skeeman. (HBCA, E.188/77)

In May 1869 he had been discharged from the Milenka of Peterhead at Peterhead and in December 1871

from the Constance of Banff at Fraserburgh. (HBCA, E.188/61 & 73)

He may be the same man as the John Rennie of Peterhead (1836-1917) described in Gavin Sutherland, The Whaling Years: Peterhead (1788-1893), Centre for

Scottish Studies: University of Aberdeen, 1993, p. xiii.
