Appointments & Service

Outfit year:            Position:                                        Post:  District:                          HBCA Reference:

*An Outfit year ran from 1 June to 31 May

In a report dated 28 June 1888, an A. de souza at Mattawa is described as "a clerk, 31 years of age, 1 yr, service, married, 3 children." (HBC

Archives D.25/4,fo.113) Despite the difference in name, this is clearly the same man who is later referred to as John de Sousa. Apparently he was

originally engaged as a store clerk, "having been accustomed to the Dry Goods trade of which he appears to have considerable knowledge." (HBC

Archives, D.25/14, Fo. 433.) By 1889 he had assumed additional duties as an accountant: "The clerk has entire charge of the Saleshop and in

addition is Accountant for the Temiscamingue district." (HBC Archives, D.25/7,fo.282) The last reference to John de Sousa at Mattawa is dated 25

September 1896. (HBC Archives, D.24/3.) In every report he is commended as a hard-working and efficient employee.
