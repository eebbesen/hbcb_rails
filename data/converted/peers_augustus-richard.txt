    Augustus Richard Peers was a native of Lymington, Hampshire, England, and entered the service of the Hudson's Bay Company as an

the 18th August, 1842.(1)

the Mackenzie River District, to which post he had been appointed.(2) He arrived at Fort Simpson on the 20th August following (3) and remained at

that place until the 18th June, 1844, when he was sent to take charge of Fort Norman in the same district.(4) He arrived there on the 20th June.(5)

During trading season 1847-48, he was transferred to the charge of Peel River Post and he arrived there on the 16th September, 1847.
