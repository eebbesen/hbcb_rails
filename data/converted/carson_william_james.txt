William James Carson was born in Montreal on 17 September 1881. He entered the service of the Company on 1 June 1903 and served as an

apprentice clerk at Rigolet until 1906. From 1906 to 1907 he was a clerk at Rigolet and from 1907 to 1917 a clerk at North west River. From 1917

to 1922 he was an accountant at the St. John's Agency, from 1922 to 1923 the Chief Clerk there, and from 1923 until his death in May 1928, The

Manager.  (HBC Archives, A.92/Corr. 17/32, Letter C.C.  No. 5145, 16 July 1928, enclosure, "Record of Service".)

Other records fill out or even contradict the "Record of Service". According to "Fur Trade Character Reports Clerk & Postmaster," p.158, (HBC

Archives; unclassified documents) Carson was the manager at Bersimis in 1911 and 1912. He was a buyer in the Labrador District from 1 June

1919 to 31 May 1921. (HBC Archives, D.33/19, fo.3.) D.33/20,fo.3). He served as a Post Manager in the Labrador District from 1 June 1921 to 31

May 1922. (HBC Archives, D.33/21,fo.3.) He was appointed Manager of the St. John's Agency on 1 June 1922. (HBC archives, D.33/22,fo.3.)

Apart from these differences, other records and the "Record of Service" tally.

The entry in the St. John's Agency journal for 14 May 1928 reads in part:

                        Very dull and cold all day - Raining at Intervals - W.J. Carson died at 2 a.m. after a few

                        hours illness. (HBC Archives, B.476/a/8,fo.69.)                                                                ARCHIVES

                                                                                                                                       WINNIPEG
