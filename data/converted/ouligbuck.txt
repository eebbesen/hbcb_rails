Ouligbuck (or Ooligbuck, Oulybuck, Ullebuck). An Eskimo. He was attached to Franklin's expedition of 1825-27. In June 1826 Ouligbuck was

attached to Dr. Richardson's party which surveyed the coast between the MacKenzie and Coppermine Rivers. At the end of the expedition

Ouligbuck returned to the Churchill district and in 1829 he became an employee of the Hudson's Bay Company, his duties varying from killing

whales, making paddles and repairing nets, to weeding turnips in the Fort garden. In the autumn of 1829 Ouligbuck left Churchill for Moose Factory

where he was employed until the summer of 1830 when he was attached to the Nicol Finlason's party which established Fort Chimo. He proved very

useful in opening trade with the Eskimos.  After spending six and half years at Fort Chimo Ouligbuck was recalled to join the Dease and Simpson

expedition, which he eventually joined in April 1839. In the summer of that year he was a member of the party which descended the Coppermine

River and made discoveries along the coast as far east as Inglis Bay. Ouligbuck continued to be employed by the Company at York and Churchill,

and both he and his son were with Dr. John Rae on his expedition of 1846-47. Ouligbuck died in the autumn of 1852. (Search file)
