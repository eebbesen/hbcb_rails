May 1916-July 1946                         Winnipeg Store                                                             RG2/37/81*

A record tracing entire career has not been found. "A List of Employees At Winnipeg Retail Store [Main Street],

January 4th 1922" describes him as the paymaster in the store office.                                                 RG2/6/27

When he retired, he is said to have been working in the Historical Exhibit in the Portage Avenue Store.               The Bayonet, Sept. 1946, p.  15

Correspondence files on the topic 'Relics' (RG2/8/1058-1086) confirm that prior to the appointment of

Clifford Wilson, Percy Harrison's title was Curator, Museum. (RG2/8/1062, 12 Mar. 1936; RG2/8/1074, 10 Feb. 1936)

The authority for acquiring items, however, rested with Douglas MacKay, The Beaver Editor. Harrison continued to

work in the Historical Exhibit after Wilson's appointment. As MacKay and Wilson had their offices at 77 Main Street,

Harrison was presumably the Exhibit's man on the spot at the Portage Avenue store.
