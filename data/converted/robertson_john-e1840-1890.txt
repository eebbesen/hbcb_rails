Records consulted do not give the names of posts; however, John Robertson 'E' signed

a contract at Fort Yukon on 29 April l853, aged 26 (HBCA A.32/5l, fo. l27) The fact

that he worked as a storesman suggests that he was at Norway House itself, where

there was a large warehouse.

He was the brother of Robert Robertson (fl. l85l-l860)

See E.193 for additional information.
