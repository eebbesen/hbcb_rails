*An Outfit year ran from 1 June to 31 May

Andre St. Martin joined the employ of the Hudson's Bay Company in the Columbia Department in 1837 as a middleman (i.e: an oarsman on a freight

canoe or York boat). No contract of employment has survived in the Archives for St. Martin but from the series of "Abstracts of Servants'

Accounts" it is known that initially he agreed to a three-year term of employment. According to different books in this same series St. Martin is

shown as coming from Sorel (on the south bank of the St. Lawrence below Montreal) or from Lachine (above Montreal). His age is given as 25 for

outfit 1839-40. H.B.C. Archives B.223/g/4, fo.23d; B.239/g/17, fo.54; B.239/g/19, fo.75).

For outfit 1838-39 St. Martin is listed in the "Abstracts" as employed at the "Graz{in}g farm" (i.e: Cowlitz). He continued to be employed at

Cowlitz for outfit 1839-40. H.B.C. Archives b.239/g/18, fo.57; B.239/g/19, fo.75).

At the expiration of his first contract in 1840 St. Martin contracted to remain with the Company for a further three years. By 1840 he was technically

speaking, an employee of the Puget's Sound Agricultural Company. For outfit 1840-41 he remained at Cowlitz and was in 1841 transferred to

Nisqually, another establishment of the Puget's Sound Agricultural Company. He is listed in the "Abstracts" as employed at Nisqually for 1841-42

and 1842-43. In 1843 he apparently left the Company's employ for he is listed in the "Abstracts" for 1843-44 under the heading "Columbia Servants

­ Retired to Canada 1843". (H.B.C. Archives B.239/g/20, fo.77; F.15/3, fo.21; B.223/g/6, fo.33; B.239/g/21, fo.83; B.239/g/22, fo.84; B.239/g/23,
