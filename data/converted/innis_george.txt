1822, 27 July  Letter from George Simpson, York Factory, to Allan McDonell:                              D.4/1 pp. 128, 129

               Supposes that Swan River will be McDonell's headquarters with Innis as Accountant

               later states:

               "George Innis I understand is a trifling extravagant inconsiderate man, not sufficiently

               correct as an Accountant nor steady for the charge of a Post; he has been raised from

               the ranks thro' favor without any particular merit, is between 80 and 90 in debt and

               this Season sent an order down for goods to the amount of 20, through which I have

               struck my pen; any person therefore who is so careless of his own means cannot be

               supposed to deal economically with those of his Employers, under these circumstances

               it may be well to bring him out next year to be disposed of as the Council think proper,

               but in the meantime it will be proper that he gets no more out of the Store than is absolutely

               required for his Winter use."
