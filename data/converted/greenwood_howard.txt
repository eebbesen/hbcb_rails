Enclosure to Letter to H.W.A. Kilgour, Esq.

Howard F. Greenwood, who entered the H.B.C. services in 1874, was a native of Halifax, Nova Scotia. He was employed until 1876 as a clerk in

the Company's Montreal Agency, being transferred to Fort Garry ­ afterwards Winnipeg ­ the depot for the Company's "Northern Dept.".

He eventually became accountant for the Northern Department and is described in 1881 by the Company's Chief Commissioner as "a good clerk

and steady".

He appears to have retired from the service in or about 1883, and in 1898 he was apparently residing at Edmonton, Alberta, when we find a letter

addressed to Mrs. J.G. Stewart ­ the widow of James Green Stewart, Senior ­ "C/o H.F. Greenwood Esq. Edmonton P.O. Alberta".
