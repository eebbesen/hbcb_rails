*An Outfit year ran from 1 June to 31 May

Joseph Sivigny was engaged by the Agents of the North West Company in Montreal in the winter of 1820. According to the terms of his

engagement he was to serve that company for three years in the capacity of Middleman. At he time of his engagement he was twenty years of age,

and was described as of the parish of L'Assomption. After the coalition of the Hudson's Bay and North West Companies in March, 1821, his service

appear to have been transferred to the Hudson's Bay Company, and on May 16, 1821, he was sent from Lachine to Fort William, on the first stage of

his journey to the Athabasca District.

During the outfits of 1821-22 and 1822-23 Sivigny was stationed in the Athabasca District. At the end of outfit 1822-23 he was transferred to the

Western Caledonia District, where he remained during the outfits of 1823-24 and 1824-25. On the expiry of his contract in 1824 he appears to have

entered into a new engagement of service with the Company for a further two years, but at the end of outfit 1824-25 retired to Montreal, although this

new contract was not due to expire until 1826.

During his period of service with the Hudson's Bay Company Sivigny was paid the following rates:
