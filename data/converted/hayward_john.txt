According to the caption of a photograph of Hayward, taken by James Cantley, 1918/19:

[Hayward was] mentioned by Edith May Griffis as going by himself from Resolute* to her school at

York Factory in 1912 - the only Eskimo there- good student. Left after one winter as place & climate

did not agree with him. He was about 12 when he arrived, & told her a great deal about Eskimo life

& customs.     When he arrived he said his name was just Hayward - she gave him the `John'.                   HBCA Photo Coll.,   1987/257/N198

* An ms of E.M. Griffis's memoirs gives `Repulse', which seems more likely.                                   RG2/71/25
