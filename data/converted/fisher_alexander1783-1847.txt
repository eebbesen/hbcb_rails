Father: Alexander Fisher - the first judge of the Midland District of Upper Canada (Search File)

From George Simpson's Character Book - 1832:

Chief Trader No.10

About 45 years of Age.     A trifling thoughless superficial lying creature, who has no Steadiness or consistancy, full of plans which are more

changeable than the Wind: has sufficient address to pass himself off as a sharp fellow with a Stranger, but is entirely an Eye Servant and cannot be

entrusted with any business requiring the least management unless closely Watched. Can make himself agreeable to Indians until they discover his

falsehood which must very soon be the case, as he is totally regardless of truth, in fact, a habitual Liar without conduct or principle, and was

becoming so much addicted to Liquor that I found it necessary to remove him a few years ago to one of our most Sober Stations."
