Joachim Hubert, from the parish of Sault St. Louis (in present-day Quebec) served the Company for a period of about thirty years, between 1812  and

1843, in the capacity of Middleman in the Columbia Department (present-day British Columbia). (HBC Archives B.239/g/61-82)

In 1824-25 his age was listed as thirty years (HBC Archives B.239/g/64, fo.39) and between 1838 and 1841 he was listed as being posted at Fort

Colvile in the Columbia Department.

Prior to 1821, it appears that Joachim Hubert may have served with the North West Company.     A few of the North West Company records are

deposited in the Hudson's Bay Company Archives but Joachim Hubert's name has not been traced.
