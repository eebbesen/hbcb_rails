   In a confidential conduct and character report for the Ungava District dated 11 Sept. 1888, Peter MacKenzie of Fort Chimo wrote: "Mr. Robert

   Gray, the clerk here, is a very good sort of fellow, and thoroughly understands the trade both with Indians & Esquimaux, but although he has now

   been here six years, he could not be left in charge, he does not know how to keep his place, and is hail fellow well met with the men, as if one of

   themselves, he comes from Stromness, his father is a fisherman there, so that our men being mostly from that place, know all about him, and he

   does not try to keep them at a distance. I am at him all the time about it, but it makes no difference. I dare say he would do better in a place

   where there are no Orkadians. It would be necessary, however, for my successor to have him here for at least one year, and with his help would

   have no difficulty in mastering the business of the place." (D.38/40 fo. 1; also D.38/6b, p.62). See D.38/7 (p. 376) for a later report on Robert

   Gray.
