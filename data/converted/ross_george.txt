+The Montreal Department Abstracts of Servants Accounts (B.134/g series) are missing for some years and

when available do not usually indicate what post Ross was at. Up to 1830 he seems to have been connected

with Timiskaming as well as Lachine (B.134/g/6; Search File). For the year 1830-31 his winter

residence was `Cocosho' and for 1836-1837 `Nabayssipi' [Nabesipi] (B.134/g/8 & 11)                      During the year

1837-1838 "Mr Ross was absent from his post 7 mo. to procure medical advice for Mrs Ross." (B.134/g/12)

Note: Ross appears on a tally of "Men's hunts at Nabaysipie [Nabesipi] Winter 1833/34" [October-April]; appears to have been in charge of the post during

this time (B.137/a/1 fos. 13d-14, microfilm 1M96)
