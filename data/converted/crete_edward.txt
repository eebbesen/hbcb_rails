*Extract from Catholic Church Records of the Pacific Northwest: Vancouver, Stellamaris Mission (St. Paul Oregon, French Prairie Press, 1972): page A-17 & A-18 "1821-1894 Edouard Crete,

son of Baptiste Crete and Marie Anne Laur of Canada, was a French Canadian voyageur, according to his son.... Crete came by canoe route across Canada to the West in 1838 and was employed

as master of the canoe and bateau `fleet' for the Hudson's Bay Company.... He worked in connection with Peter Skene Ogden for years. In 1849 he retired to Crate's Point below The Dalles,

raising stock and transporting immigrants down river in partnership with Charles Lefeve, of Pendleton. He married Sophie Boucher, and was the father of fourteen children"; and page A-10

"1825-c.1915, Sophie Boucher was the grand-daughter of James McDougall of the Hudson's Bay Company and a native woman. She was born in eastern Canada, came to British Columbia in her

youth, and married Edouard Crete, also of the Hudson's Bay Company. Her long married life was spent mainly in the Walla Walla country and The Dalles. She died at the reported age of ninety-

two in a Portland hospital, and is buried with her husband and several of their children in the Catholic Cemetery at The Dalles".
