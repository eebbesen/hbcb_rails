One reference noted that Mr. Mitchell was a "good swimmer..." and "In view of last year's fatalities among           A.102/197

apprentices we have insisted on swimming as a qualification for apprentices to the Fur Trade." [Feb. 1, 1928]

Ironically, Mr. Mitchell drowned on Sunday morning, September 2, 1928 in the Wenesaga River near Pine Ridge,

Northwestern Ontario, when he and a friend, in their canoe, attempted to cross a stream over a waterfall.

When the current capsized the canoe, the friend reached shore, but Mr. Mitchell drowned. After extensive

dragging of the river, Mr. Mitchell's body was located, and his mother arranged for the body to be returned home to

Peterhead, Scotland.
