* B.239/g/77-82 and B.223/d/214 lists "Culbert" Robillard while corresponding documentation in B.223/g/5-8, "Cuthbert" Robillard is listed. Other

information, such as post, age, parish and wages correspond and, therefore, it is probable that the references refer to the same man. In B.239/g/83-86, the

records refer to Cuthbert Robillard again, although there is a three-year discrepancy in age.

Robillard is listed in B.239/u/1 (p.300, #1789) as a Middleman from April - August, 1843. Remarks: "to become a freeman in the Columbia if he desires           it  at

the expiration of his contract.)

Wife: Marie Okanagan (widow of André Picard), married on 9 November 1846 (Catholic Church Records of the Pacific Northwest).
