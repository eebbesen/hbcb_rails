W.G. "Jim" Fuller was born in Fulham, England on 25 July 1878. He came to Canada in 1910. For 20 years he worked as a plasterer until in April

1912 he began a temporary job as porter in the Hudson's Bay Company's store on Main Street, Winnipeg, it being too early in the season to practice

his trade. He was soon persuaded to stay permanently. In October 1912 he lost his left arm while attempting to retrieve a customer's gold pin which

had fallen into the elevator shaft. After the accident he worked as a timekeeper in the Main Street store. He operated a freight elevator in the Portage

Avenue store (opened 1926), until his retirement on pension in August 1946.

He died at his home, 612 Furby Street, on 22 October 1947 and is buried in Brookside Cemetery. He was a member of the Imperial Veterans

Association and the Amputation Veterans Club.
