1876       "[he] has about the greatest capacity for work of any I have seen in the North for some time and will no doubt make a first rate officer for the

           North. He feels rather sore about Mr Nason and others who have served a shorter time than he has getting a higher salary and I would be glad if

           you could allow him similar advantages otherwise he might leave and join any opposition who may come to the District." (D.38/26 fo.6d)

1882       "He is active and intelligent with considerable experience in office work, and altho not always accurate, has improved latterly, and may be

           considered a fair accountant. He is deficient in tact and judgement as an Indian trader and post manager, but at all times very willing and zealous

           in the discharge of his duty. His conduct and behaviour I have always found irreproachable." (D.38/30 fo. 1)

1885       "as District Accountant , has been attentive and careful. During the Transport Season he has had charge of Smoky River Depot where he has

           discharged his duties faithfully - For some time he acted as Indian Trader at Dunvegan, but being somewhat unpopular I considered it advisable to

           place that duty in the hands of another. He, however, as occasion requires, visits our Grand Prarie Outpost and is successful in collecting furs -

           His general character and conduct is good." (D.38/30 fos.2-2d)
