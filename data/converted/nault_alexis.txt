*An Outfit year ran from 1 June to 31 May

Alexis Nault, a native of Rupert's Land, signed a contract with the Hudson's Bay Company at the Red River Settlement on 8 January, 1838 to serve

as a middleman ( ie: an oarsman on a freight canoe or York boat). His age was listed as 23 years in 1838. In 1841 he was appointed as a bowsman

(ie: the crewman of a canoe or York boat whose position is in the bow) in the Saskatchewan District. He apparently left the service of the Company

in 1843 but re-joined the following year and served as a middleman and as a steersman (ie: the foreman of a crew on a freight canoe or York boat) in

the Saskatchewan District until 1857. That year he was recorded in the accounts book of the Company as being a freeman (ie: a former employee of

a fur company who elected to remain in the interior as an independent trapper or trader with the Indians) in that District.
