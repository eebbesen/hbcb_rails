* Extracts from Jamie Morton's Fort Langley Vol. 1 (Environment Canada, 1988 Report #340) pp. 267-268:

"When [Augustus] Willing deserted in 1856, William Emptage, whom Yale described as `a Jack Tar with one arm' took his place [as Interpreter]. It is not known if Emptage

continued in this role through 1858."

"...Emptage is said to have been born in 1829, and married to a Musqueaum woman named Louisa, born in the same year.   Emptage, an Englishman, had been a seaman on

H.B.C. vessels until a blasting accident in the Queen Charlotte Islands resulted in the amputation of his lower arm."

"Whether Emptage was married prior to 1858, or had children at that time, is unknown."
