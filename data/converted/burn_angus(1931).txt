December 1954, p. 24: Nelson River District ­ South Indian Lake Post:

             Post Manager Angus Burn carried on, and was joined in July by Clerk Bruce Wilson from the Manitoba District. For a mere

             bachelor, Angus is to be congratulated on his fine gardening effort. Some broad beans he had sent from Scotland went all-out to

             prove that they, too, could acclimatize to Canada. By way of returning the compliment (or is it retaliation?), Angus is trying to

             convert his family back home to Canadian tastes in corn.

Freeze-Up 1955, p. 15: Nelson River District ­ South Indian Lake Post:

             Angus Burn will now be trying to outdo his gardening efforts of last year.  Just fancy the married folks letting a bachelor carry off

             gardening prizes!

Break-Up 1957, p. 24: Northern Ontario District

             Angus (McBagpipe) Burn transferred to his former stamping ground, Trout Lake, on his return from the Scottish moors, where he had

             repaired early last fall to gather a brace or two of grouse. Incidentally, Angus had the pleasure of taking over a brand new and

             modern store which had been completed and fully stocked immediately prior to his arrival at Trout Lake.

Break-Up 1958, p. 12: Northern Ontario District

             Gardening competition results recently published show two prize winners in the District. This is encouraging and we are now looking

             forward to renewed effort in 1958. Both Trout Lake and Big Beaver House Posts have been experimenting with ornamental shrubs

             with some success. Angus Burn is particularly happy about his Russian Olives, although it is unlikely they will produce sizeable fruit

             in the northern region.
