*An Outfit year ran from 1 June to 31 May

Ramsay Crooks, as director of the American Fur Company, had frequent communication with Governor Simpson of the Hudson's Bay Company in

the 1830's and 1840's with regard to competition in the Rainy Lake area. In 1833 an agreement was reached between the American Fur Company

and the Hudson's Bay Company in which the former would abandon all its frontier posts from Pembina to Lake Superior in exchange for an annual

payment of 300 sterling. The agreement was renewed periodically until 1847.

(Galbraith, John S.,The Hudson's Bay Company as an Imperial Factor, 1821-1869 (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1957) pp.57-59)

Correspondence between Crooks and Governor Simpson has survived in the Archives from the 1830's to 1859, the year of Crooks' death.

Little research has been undertaken with regard to the nature of Crooks' association with Governor Simpson and the Company after 1847. However,

a cursory glance through the surviving correspondence indicates that he kept the Governor informed mainly about the market for Buffalo Robes in

New York.
