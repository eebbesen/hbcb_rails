His Royal Highness James, Duke of York, Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, 1863-85

James was born on 14 October 1633, son of Charles 1 and Henrietta Maria and created Duke of York in January 1643. He was at Oxford when the

city surrendered in 1646 to the Parliamentarians. He was sent to London and placed in St. James's Palace, from where he escaped to The Hague in

April 1648.

At the Restoration in 1660 James returned to England and was appointed Lord High Admiral, and Warden of the Cinque Ports. He reorganized and

overhauled the British Navy.

In December 1660 James admitted to having contracted a secret marriage with Anne Hyde (1637-1671) daughter of Lord Clarendon the previous

September. In 1672 he made a public announcement of his conversions to Roman Catholicism.

After the death of Prince Rupert on 29 November 1682, James was elected Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company and resigned to become King of

England in February 1685.

King James's religious policies promoted the Whig Lords in June 1688 to ask Prince William of Orange to bring an Army to England and restore

civil liberties. Prince William arrived at Torbay in November 1688 and King James escaped to France. Louis X1V gave him a home at St. Germain.

He died there on 17 September 1701.
