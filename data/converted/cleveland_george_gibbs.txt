In 1919 Captain Cleveland transported two buildings from Fullerton to establish an outpost at Beach Point

on the South side of Repulse Bay. In 1921 he established Repulse Bay as a Post because it was felt to be

too far from Chesterfield to be treated as a Post.                                                                               A.74/48:70-71; A.74/50:94

Captain Cleveland was a well-known Arctic figure. The Nelson River District Manager, Christie Harding,

said of him in 1919: "Mr. Cleveland is an old timer and has been 28 years in the country, which he knows well.

He talks the Eskimo language, is a good trader, navigator and engineer - a jack of all trades, and the most practical

man I met on my tour of inspection."                                 (A.74/49, fo. 78)                                           ARCHIVES
