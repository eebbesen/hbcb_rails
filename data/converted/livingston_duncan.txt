It appears that Duncan Livingston was initially in the service of the North West Company., The exact date of his engagement is difficult to

determine, since the only reference to him traced was an account of wages recorded in 1819 (HBCA f4/32a, p.991).

After the amalgamation of the North West and Hudson's Bay Companies in 1821, Duncan Livingston was engaged by the Company to serve in the

Western Caledonia District as an Interpreter and Midman (or Middleman was a crewman of a canoe who worked the paddles or oars from a middle

position in the craft). In May of 1824 he deserted the Company's service, but returned in February of the following year. (HBC Arch. B.239/g/1-4;

B.188/d/8, p.70). He remained in this District and in this capacity until his death on April 16, 1828. (HBC Arch. B.239/g/5-8)
