1859-63                 With the closing of the post, Samuel Miller was retired in 1859.        He appears in HBC ledgers until the 1862-63 year, but

                            received no wages during this period. (B.134/g/35-37; D.5/52,fo.300, B.17/c/1, fos. 186-188)

*The post was closed in 1859 when the Hudson's Bay Company's leases on the King's Post terminated. See letter from Samuel Miller to `Hector

Mackinsey {McKenzie} dated Belles Emistes' {Betsiamits}, 22 July 1860, (enclosure to B.17/c/1, fos.185-186). This is the only signature by Miller

traced in the records and the only place where his name has been found as Miller, not Millard.

The correspondence refers to his account (B.17/c/1fos.185-188)

Although he is not mentioned by name it seems not unlikely that Samuel Miller is the man referred to by Colin Rankin in his letter to James S. Watt

at Lachine dated 6 September 1855, as a `...married man...He has only one small child and is an excellent man ­ having remained ten years with Mr.

Price at Saut au Cochon as a sort of foreman. I engaged him at Twenty-five pounds per annum and am certain of his giving satisfaction."

(B.134/c/72, fos.438-438d)
