*An Outfit year ran from 1 June to 31 May

Edward Edwards Langford, of Brighton and a distant relative of Governor Blanshard, signed a contract as a bailiff with the Puget's Sound

Agricultural Company in 1850. He became one of the group hostile to the Company and Douglas. The heavy losses at Esquimalt Farm, of which       he

had charge, and his unresonable expenditures on "Madeira, Sherry, Port, Hyson Tea,....to regale his friend's sorely tested the patience of the

Company. His contract, which was to terminate in 1861, was not renewed.
