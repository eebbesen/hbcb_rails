Outfit Year*:                              Position:        Post:                          District:      HBCA Reference:

*An Outfit year ran from 1 June to 31 May

1865-1869                                  Postmaster       Kootenais                      Fort Shepherd  B.226/g/13-17; SF `Kootenay'

1869, December                             Dismissed                                                      B.226/b/43, fo. 40

After Phillipps's dismissal, apparently for incompetence and inability to adapt to changing circumstances in the Kootenay trade, Chief Factor Roderick Finlayson

described him as "a young man well introduced to us... I first ordered him to the district in 1863 to succeed Mr Linklater as Indian trader." 1863 may be a slip of

the pen for 1865 (B.226/b/43,fo. 41).

In G.P.V. and Helen B. Akrigg, 1001 British Columbia Place Names, Discovery Press, Vancouver, 1970, article on Phillipps Creek, pp. 134-135:

           After Michael Phillipps, son of the Rev. Thomas Phillipps of Densall, Hertfordshire. He is an interesting transitional figure in the history of

           the East Kootenay. Originally he was an H.B.C. clerk at Fort Kootenay and married Rowena, daughter of Chief David of the Tobacco Plains

           Indians. Later he became the first homesteader in the district, and the first Indian Agent in the area. He prospected along the Elk River in

           1873 and was disgusted at finding nothing but coal. He may have discovered the Crowsnest Pass from the west in 1873, ignorant that it had

           already been found by the Palliser expedition. He died in 1916.
