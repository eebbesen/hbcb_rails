One record describes him as stationed at Isle a la Crosse from 1904 to 1906. (D.38/55:271)

Souris River was an outpost of Isle a la Crosse. The Post History for Souris River indicates

that he ceased to be in charge there in 1905.

Isle a la Crosse correspondence (B.89/b & c) confirms that he was in charge of Portage La Loche in 1908/09.

District Manager R.H. Hall noted in Nov. 1906: "Fairly good trader, speaks Cree well & has sufficient education

to keep the accounts of one of the minor Posts. Would be useless where he could procure liquor." (D.38/55:271)
