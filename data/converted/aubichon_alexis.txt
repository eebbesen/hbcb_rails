Alexis Aubichon was former North West Company employee who joined the Hudson's Bay Company in the Columbia District in 1821 with the union of the two fur

trade firms. The accounts' book of the Company for 1824 listed his age as 33 years, his parish as Berthier, Quebec, his capacity as Middleman (i.e. an oarsman on a

freight canoe or York Boat), and his years of service in the fur trade as 10.

He accompanied Chief Trader, Alexander Roderick McLeod, on his expeditions to the Umpqua Country during 1826-1827. He served as Middleman and trapper

with the Hudson's Bay Company for several years on other fur trading expeditions in the old Oregon Territory. It appears from the accounts' books that he left the

service of the Company in 1841 at the age of 50 and became a settler in Willamette, Oregon. This is the last reference traced to him.
