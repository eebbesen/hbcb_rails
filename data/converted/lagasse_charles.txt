North West Company

1811-1821                                                                                         Columbia             F.4/32,p.553; F.4/46,p.26

Hudson's Bay Company

His contract was transferred to the Hudson's Bay Company at its union with the                                         F.4/46, p. 26

North West Company in 1821 but he was a `freeman' [his contract had expired]                                           B.239/g/1,fo.87

by 1822 and he does not seem to have been engaged by the HBC after that.

North West Company records locate him as a `milieu' [middle position in canoe]

at Fort George [Astoria] for the winter of 1813/1814.                                                                  F.4/61, fo. 6d.

There was a La Gasse at the Flathead post in 1813. This may have been André

Lagasse.                                                                                                               F.4/61, fo.4; Coues, p. 50

By 1821 he had become a `boute' [steersman or bowsman].                                                                F.4/46, p. 26

The name also appears as Lagace, Lagacé,Lagacie, Le Gosse, La Gassi.

He is probably the Charles Lagacé who was with David Thompson, 1800-1801,

1808-10, 1811. (Coues, Elliott, ed., New Light On The Early History of

the Greater Northwest: The Manuscript Journals of Alexander Henry... and

of David Thompson, 1799-1814 (New York, 1897), Vol. I, p. 51.)
