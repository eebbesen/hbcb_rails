*An Outfit year ran from 1 June to 31 May

   Peter Morrison's initial contract with the Hudson's Bay Company dates from 10 April 1859, when he was engaged for four years as an apprentice

blacksmith as from 1 June 1859. He is shown as being seventeen years of age and from Albany. His signature reads `Petter Morrison', though on

later contracts presumably by the same man, it reads `Peter Morrison'. The contract of 1859 was witnessed by a James Morrison (H.B.C. Arch.

A.32/47, fo.64). The following extract from letter from Chief Trader Richard Hardisty to Chief Factor John McKenzie at Moose Factory, dated

Albany, 28 March 1859 is of relevance:

                        `Our blacksmith here has a Son whom he wishes to have engaged in the Service. The lad is about 17 years of age, and as

               he has been working in the forge with his father for the last three or four years is a pretty good blacksmith, indeed his father could not

               do the work here without his assistance. He can make either Axes or Traps, and in fact almost anything else...'

                                                                           (H.B.C. Arch. B.3/b/91, fo.38)

   Peter Morrison's father is presumably `James Morrison "a" `* described at Albany Servants' Register of the period as `Blacksmith

Superannuated Annuity 20', from Orkney (H.B.C. Arch. B.3/f/10, fo.3). In the Southern Department `Abstracts of Servants' Accounts; for 1860-

61 James Morrison `a' is shown as blacksmith in the Albany River District, aged 70 with 50 years Hudson's Bay Company employ (H.B.C.. Arch.

B.135/g/43, fo.11). His initial account with the Company shows that he came from the parish of St Ola, Orkneys (H.B.C. Arch. A.16/7, fo.119).

Named of the wife of James Morrison `a' is not known. The only beneficiary mentioned in his will of 18 August 1870 is his youngest daughter

`Jannet' {sic} (H.B.C. Arch. A.36/10, fo.240).

   The Company's Albany post journal was read for 1842 and up to June 1843 in the hope of finding reference to the birth of Peter Morrison. There

are frequent references to James Morrison employed at his trade, but none to his family (H.B.C. Arch. B.3/a/147-8).

·  The "a" was to distinguish him from another man of the same name in the Company's accounts.
