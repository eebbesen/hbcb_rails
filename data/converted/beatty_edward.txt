Beatty appears to have been employed for some years prior to 1904.

The Abstracts of Servants Accounts for 1908 credit him with 13 years service. (D.33/7)

A memo dated 20 May 1901 refers to him as "engaged as a temporary servant and placed in charge of the new winter Post belonging to Lac                              La  Ronge

...at Whitefish Lake on North side of the Churchill ....

If the Post has proved successful I would recommend that Beatty be engaged              ... & retained in charge." (B.235/z/4, file 2).

Isle a la Crosse Correspondence (B.89/b & c) confirms that he was in charge at Green Lake in 1908/09.

District Manager R.H. Hall noted in November 1906: "Is a good man in all respects. Fair except that he is poor at a/cs.

He understands Ind[ian]s & their language & has so far proved active and zealous." (D.38/55:89)
