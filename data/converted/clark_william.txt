William Clark - page 2

Search file "Clark, William" contains copies of newspaper articles from the Legislative Library of Manitoba and of                  the entry on Clark from F.H. Schofield,

The Story of Manitoba, Vol. II (1913), pp. 120-123. According to Schofield Clark was born in Kirkwall, the son of William Clark and Eliza Mowat (Aim). He

was educated at Sandwick and then moved to the mainland of Scotland to work as a clerk in a shipping company at Granton Pier, near Edinburgh. On his

contract, signed 13 June 1861, Clark gives his address as Laverock Bank House, Trinity, Newhaven, Edinburgh. The witness to his signature is James Clark of

the same address. (A.32/24a, fo. 53)         In a letter to the HBC Secretary, dated 11 April 1861 Clark said that he had been appointed to his clerkship by Edward

Ellice [HBC Deputy Governor]. (A.10/49, fo. 430)

According to Schofield, Clark married Julia Murray of Kildonan in 1882. She was the daughter of Donald and Jane Murray. The Anglican Parish registers

index in the Provincial Archives of Manitoba show that Donald Murray and Jane Mary Heron were married on 17 August 1837. Their daughter Julia Jane was

baptized at St. Paul's on 7 January 1861.

His obituary states that Clark was survived by his wife and two nephews, William Clark of Winnipeg and James Clark of Clarkleigh MB.
