*An Outfit year ran from 1 June to 31 May

Fugl, born at Copenhagen, Denmark in 1871, first entered the employ of the Hudson's Bay Company on 20 October 1890. He was initially

employed as an apprentice clerk in the same area. He retired 1 June 1898 disapproving of the manner in which the business was conducted. Fugl

was induced to re-enter the employ two years later and was engaged in the Company's St Lawrence District as a Post Master until 1 October 1902.

His dismissal then apparently arose from his inability to work in harmony with his superior officer, John S. Black. From this date he seems to have

worked for some time for Revillon Freres.

In April 1911 Fur Trade Commissioner, R.H. Hall appointed Fugl General Manager of the Company's Athabasca District, headquarters at Edmonton.

At this date Fugl was noted as being married, but with no family. Fugl continued as Manager of the Athabasca District until Summer 1917 when his

resignation was necessitated by his acceptance of a nomination to stand as a candidate for the

Alberta Legislature.
