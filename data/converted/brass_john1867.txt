John Brass was a native of Rupert's Land but it is not known where he was born. He may have been the son of Peter Brass. John Brass joined the

Hudson's Bay Company in the Swan River District in the capacity of midman (ie., an oarsman on a freight canoe or York Boat) in 1848 at wages of 17

pounds sterling per annum. He served in this capacity for a number of years before becoming a freeman (ie., a former employee of a fur company who

elected to remain in the interior as an independent trapper or trader with the Indians). He returned to the Hudson's Bay Company in 1859. According to  an

agreement made with the company dated March 25, 1859 at Fort Pelly, he agreed to serve in the capacity of steersman (ie., the foreman of a crew on a

freight canoe or York Boat) for 2 years as from june1,1859 at 25 pounds sterling per annum. He apparently continued in this employ in the Swan River

District until 1867, after which he seams e to have left the service of the Company.
