From 1857-1859, John Bangs, along with his uncle James Bangs, competed against the Hudson's Bay Company in the Timiskaming region for furs.

They maintained several stations in the neighbourhood of Fort Timiskaming until the autumn of 1859 when the partnership dissolved and John was

hired by the Hudson's Bay Company. (See, Elaine Allan Mitchell, Fort Timiskaming and the Fur Trade , University of Toronto Press; 1977;
