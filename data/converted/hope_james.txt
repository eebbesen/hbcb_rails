James Hope. A Cree Indian who, when about nine years of age and an inmate of the Missionary School in the Red River Settlement in 1822, was

baptised "James Hope". He joined the Hudson's Bay Company in 1832 as a middleman. He was employed in the Mackenzie River district and in

1839 was attached to the Dease and Simpson expedition as a bowsman. He was a member of the party which descended the Coppermine in the

summer of 1839 and explored the coast eastwards as far as Inglis Bay. Hope continued to be employed by the Hudson's Bay Company in the

Mackenzie River district until 1848. He was on his way out to the Red River Settlement when, in Slave River, he met the advance party of Sir John

Richardson's expedition in search of Sir John Franklin. Hope was engaged as an interpreter to the expedition and in the summer of 1849 was a

member of Dr. John Rae's party which Richardson instructed to descend the Coppermine River and examined the shores of Wollaston Land. The

party reached Dolphin and Union Strait, but closely packed hummocky ice and other adverse conditions obliged Rae to return to the expedition's

headquarters at Fort Confidence. After spending the winter of 1849-50 at Big Island, Great Slave Lake, James Hope retired to Red River Settlement.
