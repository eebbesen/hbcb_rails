John George Rendall's long career with the Hudson's Bay Company began in 1856 when he was fourteen years of age. For the first two years he

was not paid for his services and it is not known either in what capacity or what department of the London establishment he was employed.(1)             In

the minutes of the meeting of the Governor and Committee of the Company held on 1 February 1858 references is made to the appointment of `Mr
John Rendall Junr'(2) as a `Clerk on the Establishment his salary to be at the rate of 50 p annum till the 1st June and to increase, from that date, at

the rate of 10 p annum till it reaches 200.'(3) John George Rendall was by 1861 employed in the Company's London Shipping Department and

his address at this time is given as 47 St Peter's Road, Mile End.(4) In 1882 his salary was increased to 220 per annum.(5)

In 1885 John George Rendall's son James H. Rendall, then aged fourteen, entered the Company's service. In a list of London staff compiled in

1900 J.B. Rendall is listed as `Warehouseman' and J.H. Rendall as a `Clerk'.(6)  J.G. Rendall's death took place on 27 January 1912. This was

reported at the meeting of the Board on 30 January. The minutes record that Mr Rendall `was seized with paralysis on his way to the office on the
15th November last'. The cause of his death was given as syncope. The Secretary's letter of condolence to Mrs Rendall was addressed to her at 51

Windsor Road, Forest Gate {London, E.7}, and concluded as follows:

`Permit me to say for myself and on behalf of {sic} the whole of the members of the Company's staff both in the office and warehouse, that

each one feels to have lost a dear personal friend whose kindness and loyal attention to duty have been an example to all.'(7)
