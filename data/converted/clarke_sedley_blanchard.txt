Factor Laurence Clarke and his second wife, the sister of Thomas and John McKay of Prince Albert. He was named after his older step-sister's

husband, Sedley Blanchard of Winnipeg (see enclosed biographical note from the McPhillip's Saskatchewan Directory for 1888).

Clarke entered the Hudson's Bay Company on 9 November 1897 as an apprentice Clerk in the Cumberland District (HBC Archives Fur Trade

Engagement Register, 1892-1903, unclassified). From 6 September 1902 to 1905, when he returned to Prince Albert, Clarke served as Clerk at Isle a

at Ile a la Crosse once more. (HBC Archives, Fur Trade Character Reports, Clerk and Post Master, unclassified).

In 1915 Clarke enlisted as a Private in the 53rd Battalion, returning to the Saskatchewan District to resume his employment in 1919. He was awarded

a silver medal by the Company in May 1920 and a silver bar May 1921. The exact date of his retirement is not noted, but appears to have been in

1921. (HBC Archives, Fur Trade Retired Servants, unclassified).
