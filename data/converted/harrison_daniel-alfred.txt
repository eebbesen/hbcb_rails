                                                                                                                         fo.33

Note: The records can give conflicting evidence as to the location of service. The Minutes of the Council of the

Northern Department indicate that Harrison was appointed to Fort Simpson in June 1854, to the York Factory District

in June 1855, to Fort Simpson in June 1856 and to Fort Pelly in June 1857.                                               B.239/k/3,pp.72,109,122,146

He spent some of his career at Fort Good Hope. James Anderson wrote from Fort Simpson on 29 Nov. 1855 to

George Simpson that Harrison had been in temporary charge of Fort Good Hope while Roderick MacFarlane was

away.                                                                                                                    D.5/40, fo. 578

The Fort Good Hope account book, 1855-1856, shows that Harrison acquired the following items:

1 1/6 dozen round horse bells, 1 silver boucane - 3 ins, 1 common large horn comb, 1 tin pipe cover, ½ dozen

gun flints, 1 small boxhead gimlet, 2 pairs winter moccasins, 1 stone pipe, 4 yards black ribbon, 1 reel white

cotton thread, 3 tippets for dogs, ½ roll Irish twist tobacco.                                                           B.80/d/3, fo. 14

The "silver boucane" seems to have been acquired from the estate of Alexander Cadien.                                    B.80/d/3, fo. 11

The Abstracts of Servants Accounts for 1856-1857 indicate that he was in the Lac La Pluie district                       B.239/g/96, fo. 5

and not the Swan River, as the Council Minutes indicate.                                                                 B.239/k/3, p.146

A letter from W.J. Christie, Fort Ellice, 11 Sept. 1857, to George Simpson, is evidence that Harrison was

indeed in the Swan River district and took temporary charge of Fort Ellice while James McKay was away

accompanying Captain Palliser.                                                                                           D.5/44, fo. 270d.
