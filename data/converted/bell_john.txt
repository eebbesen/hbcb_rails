James McDougall, in his report on Northern Transport, March 1893:

The boat [Wrigley] has been run since 1887 by Capt. John Bell, whose wages are $1,500 per annum. He is an

excellent and competent Captain and Engineer and well worth the salary he receives if his services could be fully

utilized; but as the navigation of the waters of the Mackenzie is easy and he is actively employed only about

4 months in the year, a far cheaper man would answer the purpose...                                                    D.25/17, fo. 324

According to the Fort Simpson 1889 Inspection Report, Bell lived in the Officers'

House and had one child.                                                                                               B.200/e/18, fo. 6
