* He may have spent part of his first year at Rampart House. In his report on post managers and clerks,

24 March 1884, Chief Factor J.S. Camsell wrote:

Mr Millar has had no charge this year. He is young, inexperienced and has rather a better opinion of himself

than his performance so far warrants. He is not much liked either by the Rampart Indians, an additional reason

to those already given for removing him from a post where it is necessary to humour them to a certain extent to

retain them or prevent them trading with the Americans.                                                                  D.38/26, fo. 26-27d.

In his report of 30 June 1886 Camsell wrote:

Mr Chas Millar, clerk, came in with Mr [Francis] Heron in '83. He was sent to the Rampart at first but has now been

in charge of LaPierre's House for 2 years. He is doing well now and trying his best as he wishes to remain in the        D.38/6b, fo. 125d.;

+ In his report of 12 September 1889, Camsell wrote:

Mr Millar, who wintered at Providence has retired from this District this summer, he gave every satisfaction to Mr Reid

and also to Mr Wilson at Fort Rae last spring.                                                                           D.38/26, fo. 32-32d.
