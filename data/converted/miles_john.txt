*An Outfit year ran from 1 June to 31 May

John Miles was engaged by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1769 to serve as Armourer at Moose Fort (Moose Factory). He signed a five year contract

for the wage of  20. per annum for the first three years and 25. Per annum for the last two years. (HBCA, A.30/1 fos. 4d-5, A.11/43 fo.160d).

When his contract expired in 1774, John Miles indicated that he was willing to continue in his position for another three years if his wage was raised

to 30. per annum. Otherwise, he wished to return home. (HBCA, A.30/1 fos. 4d-5, A.11/43 fo.202d). The Hudson's Bay Company rejected Miles

proposal and offered him his current wage (25. per annum) for three years and a gratuity of 15. when this second contract expired in 1777.

(HBCA, B.135/c/1 fo.111).

Correspondence from Moose Factory to London dated 20 September 1774 states that "John Miles Armourer...{has} signed...{his}...contract for 3

years". (HBCA, a.11/44 fo.9). There is, however, a postscript added to the letter:

"Since writing the above our Armourer being a Man of a very contumacious disposition refuses to sign his contract on the Words Watch & Ward.

Neither will he stay or do any duty for the Factory therefore we hope your Hon's will take recognisance of Such Servants---"

The reply from London, in a letter dated 4 May 1775, was, "We appreciated your sending home Miles the Armourer last year...(HBCA, B.135/c/1

fo.116d) which would indicate that John Miles left Moose Factory in 1774.
