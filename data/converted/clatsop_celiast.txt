             "Celiast was one of three daughters of Chief Coboway to marry white men and establish a line of well-known and estimable descendants. Her

marriage to Basil Poirier was annulled because of a previous alliance on his part, after which Celiast was free to marry Solomon Smith. She

helped him with his primitive school on the Prairie and is claimed to have done so also at the Methodist Mission for Jason Lee.                           After  the

Smith's removal to Clatsop Plains on the coast, she served as a buffer and calming influence on the relations between the whites and the tribes.

Her grave, and that of her husband, in the Pioneer Cemetery there is marked with a commemorative boulder and plaque (1959) honoring their
work."1
