George Adams is listed as one of seven passengers boarding the chartered vessel Hadlow (Captain John Davidson) at Gravesend on 2 June 1815. A Joseph Adams

ad his wife May likewise boarded the Hadlow at Gravesend.                       George Adams and Joseph Adams are listed as labourers in the log of the Hadlow.  Most of the
passengers, settlers for Red River, embarked in the Orkneys. The Hadlow reached York Factory in August 18151, and it seems likely that Adams was one of the
colonists transported inland to Red River under the care of Peter Fidler2.

In summer 1816 Adams apparently joined the employ of the Hudson's Bay Company and spent the ensuing winter at Red Deer River Post, in the Company's Swan
River District3. In spring 1817 all Hudson's Bay Company posts in the Swan River District and all Company employees there were captured by the North West
Company4. Unfortunately the Swan River Post Journals for 1816-1817 have not survived to provide details5. Adams was paid £20 (twenty pounds) as wages for
this year's employ with the Company, 1816-18176.

Adams apparently was not in the Company's regular employ after 1817 but was presumably at the Red River Settlement. In 1820 he was paid £16 for two
trips to York Factory. In 1823 his debit balance of £3.9.6 in the Company's Officer's and Servants' York Factory Ledger was written off7.

              5It is not known whether Post Journals presumably kept at the Swan River District posts survived through the troubles with the North West

              Company. Most of the Northern Department Post Journals for 1816-1817 were burnt in spring 1818 in the  fire aboard the       chartered

              vessel Britannia (Captain John Edman) which had failed because of heavy ice to leave Hudson Bay for Great Britain in October 1817
