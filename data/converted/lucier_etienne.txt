Notation on F.4/61 fo. 7 indicates that North West Co. did not have any agreement "whatever" with Lucier.

"According to the reminiscences of [Donald] Manson's daughter Anna (Mrs. Tremewan)(see Oregon Historical Quarterly, IV, 261-4), her mother was a

daughter of Etienne Lucier of French Prairie, Marion County, Oregon. Anna's Brothers were Donald, James, William and Stephen; and her sisters were

Isabella and Lizzie."
