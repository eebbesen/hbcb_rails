*In his letters to The Beaver (Jan./Feb/ 1986; June/July 1986; Aug./Sept. 1988) Berchem gave the dates of

his HBC career as 1916 to 1931. He claimed 15 years service in 1931 (A.92/16/20, fo.15) There is no reason

to doubt this but so far it has not proved possible to trace the names of all the ships in which he served.

Family information: His father was Alphonse H.E. Berchem, who was employed at Worthington-Simpson Limited.

The family home was at 3, Casewick Road, London SE27 (West Norwood.)                                                     A.92/Misc./33,47,68

By 1926 Berchem had moved to 63, Argyle Road in Saltcoats, Ayrshire, near Ardrossan, the Nascopie's home port.           A.92/36/4

By 1928 his allotment [portion of salary] was sent to his wife, Nannie M. Berchem, at Rigolette, 4, Border Avenue,

Saltcoats.                                                                                                               A.106/5/11

His letters to The Beaver in the late 1980s were written from Saltcoats.

Comments on (1922): "The Captain [Falk of the Bayeskimo] gives an excellent account of this young man and

recommends him for promotion. He served as an apprentice in the "Bay" steamers and has now made several voyages

to Hudson's Bay in "Nascopie", "Baychimo" and "Bayeskimo". He requests permission to be given the time to sit for

his Chief Mate's Certificate [granted time with pay]."                                                                   A.105/54

+There is a collection of Berchem's photo albums in the McCord Museum, Montreal. A snapshot in one, showing

apprentices on the Baytigern, Indian Ocean 1917, gives his age as 15.
