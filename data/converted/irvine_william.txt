Leaving HBC service: The Commissioner, C,C, Chipman, wrote to the Board on 11 September 1896:

"Mr. Irvine, who unfortunately lately lost his wife, has a large family, and he feels it necessary to live

somewhere where they can be educated and looked after, as he has but small means. He has said always

to have been faithful and to have given satisfaction... I beg to recommend him for a Pension of £25

per annum."                                                                                                  A.12/FT  334/1a, fo. 29

Chipman wrote again on 4 June 1897:

....I beg to inform you that Mr. Wm. Irvine, who retired from the Service last year, after the death                                  ARCHIVES

                                                                                                                                      WINNIPEG

of his wife, having since made satisfactory arrangements for his family being taken care of, has applied

to be re-engaged in the Service; in view of the strong commendations as to his qualifications as an

Indian Trader that I have, and that Mr. Camsell desired his services, the renewal of his Contract for

three years has been sanctioned. The Pension authorised by the Board has therefore been cancelled.           A.12/FT  334/1a, fo. 31

Irvine wrote to Lord Strathcona on 1 September 1901 from Halcro SK, near Prince Albert, where he had

retired and gone into farming. With his large family of youngsters (his oldest son was only 13) he was

having a hard time and asked for a pension. He added a postscript to the effect that he had been advised to

trade against the HBC in the Mackenzie River area but would not do so.                                       A.12/FT  334/1a, fo. 58-59d.

Chipman offered him a job but Irvine asked too high a salary                                                 A.12/FT  334/1a, fo. 57
