**The Company's London Office Correspondence shows that employees for Vancouver Island taking passage

aboard the Norman Morison, 1849, were recruited by the Company's agent in Stromness, Orkney Islands,

Edward Clouston, and by Philip Francis of Hinton St. Mary, Dorsetshire, England. These agents accounted for

a total of twenty-six men only, and it seems that the remainder was recruited in Kent by one of the Company's

London Committee, Henry Hulse Berens, whose home was a Kevington, near St. Mary Cray, Kent. Unfortunately,

we do not have any lists detailing the men employed by each agent, so we cannot determine Robert Hunts' place of

origin or if he took a wife with him. (HBCA A.5/l6, pp. l47, l58; A.5/l7, p. l0; A.l0/27, pp. 257a, 258; A.l9/39, fo. 76; Z.8/1)
