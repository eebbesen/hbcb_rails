Sir Edward Hungerford (1632-1717). His father was Anthony Hungerford of Farleigh Castle, Somerset. Famous in the annal of the ancient family of

that name for his unbridled extravagance. Created a Knight of the Bath, 23 April, 1661 at the Coronation of Charles 11. M.P., 1660, 1678k 1679,

1681. This dashing rakehell was not without political influence. When his financial affairs grew involved, he contrived to summon Parliamentary

assistance which, in the effective form of a private act of the national legislature, enabled him to sell certain of his landed property, perhaps entailed,

which was situated in Devonshire. What the Parliamentary session of 1664-1665 began that of 1677 completed, for in the latter year, and once more

by private act, the legislature enabled this knight of the Bath"to make Leases for years of Hungerford House in the Strand in the Parish of Saint

Martins in the Fields in the Country of Midlesex and of certaine Houses and Tenements thereunto adjoyning." Approximately where in our day the

impressive Victorian Gothie of the Charing Cross railway station gives the pedestrian pause, there stood, in Sir Edward's day, the great bulk of

Hungerford House. This the spendthrift converted into stalls and so, by virture of the private act, Hungerford Market came into being. The Market

has been razed but the pedestrian with time on his hands may still cross over the Thames on Hungerford Bridge, a narrow footway paralleling the

railway viaduct, and bringing Charing Cross close to Lambeth.

The eighteenth century was out of its cradle before Sir Edward died, and extremely "ancient knight" and one deplorably poor. His was a tale of

magnificence at last sinking into mire. At first a courtier, he later changed sides, and voted with the Wings in the great political controversies which

rocked all England toward the end of Charles' reign. In 1681, he settled at Spring Gardens.

Hungerford's first cash payment was credited in the ledger on December 24, 1667; at incorporation he held 270 of stock.

Hungerford, Sir Edward

Sir Edward Hungerford, best known for his reckless extravagance, was the son of heir of Anthony Hungerford, the royalist, who died in 1657.

Edward Hungerford was born October 20, 1632, and was baptised on November 1 at Black Bourton, Oxfordshire. At the coronation of King Charles

11 on April 23, 1661, he was created a Knight of the Bath. He was elected Member of Parliament for Chippenham in 1666, 1661, 1678, 1679, and

1681; for Shoreham in 1685, 1688 and 1690; and for Steyning ;in 1695, 1698, 1700 and 1702. His town residence, Hungerford House, near

Charing Cross, was burnt down in April, 1669, and he afterwards settled in Spring Gardens. In 1679 he obtained permission to hold a market three

times a week on the site of the demolished Hungerford House, and three years later a market house was built there. Sir Christopher Wren and Sir
Stephen Fox purchased the market in 1685 and received the tolls. The market house, rebuilt in1833, was removed in1860 when Charing Cross

railway station was built on the site. Hungerford, who died in1711, is said to have been a poor knight of Windsor during his old age. He was buried

in the church of St. Martin's in the Fields, Middlesex. He married three times and had four sons, only one of whom, Edward, had issue, a son who

died young. Hungerford first acquired Hudson's Bay stock on December 24, 1667, when he paid in20. By the time of the charter of May 2, 1670,

in which he was named, he held 270. He was also named in the earlier grants dated June 23 and October 21, 1669, and April 18, 1670 (see Nute,

"Radisson and Groseilliers' Contribution to Geography", pp.423-6). His stock was increased to 300 by May 28, 1670, and he held this amount until

January 6, 1681, when he assigned his total holding to John Hayes. Hungerford was a Committee Member in 1674-75.
