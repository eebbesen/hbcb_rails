"Fraser, Simon (1776-1862) was born at Bennington, New York, in 1776, the youngest son of Capt. Simon Fraser of Guisachan and Isabelle Grant,

daughter of the Laird of Daldreggan, His father, who joined the Loyalist forces during the American Revolution, was captured by the revolutionist,

and died in prison at Albany. His mother came to Canada, and ultimately settled near Cornwall. Simon Fraser, the son, was educated at Montreal,

where his uncle, John Fraser, was a judge of the Court of Common Pleas; and in 1792 he was apprenticed to the North west Company. He was

employed in the Athabaska department as early as 1799; and he continued to be attached to this department until 1805. In 1801 he was elected a

partner of the North West Company; and in 1805 he was placed in charge of the Company's operations beyond the Rocky Mountains. In 1808 he

explored to the mouth the river that bears his name; and the journal of his exploration has been published in L.R> Masson,, Les bourgeois de la Cie.

du Nord-Quest,vol. I. Quebec, 1889 ). In 1816 he took charge of the Red River department; and in 1817 he was one of those arrested by Lord

Selkirk as an accessory to the massacre at Seven Oaks. He retired from the North West Company before 1820, and settled at St. Andrew's, near

Cornwall, Upper Canada. Here he died on April 19, 1862, aged 86 years. He was Roman Catholic, whereas most of the other Frasers in the Fur-

trade were Protestants. After he returned from the West he married a daughter of Allan Macdonall, at Matilda, Upper Canada. An account of his life

will be found in W.N. Sage, Simon Fraser, exployer and fur-trader (Proceedings of the Pacific Coast

Branch of the Amer. Hist. Assoc., 1929)."
