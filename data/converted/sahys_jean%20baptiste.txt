1886, 31 May            May be the Baptiste Sahys listed under Customers'                Outstanding  Balances,

                        Cumberland House                                                                                     B.49/e/12, fo. 20

He was described by Chief Factor Horace Belanger as " a good Indian trader and a hard

working man" (1874), "a good faithful old servant" (1875), and "a zealous person [who]

has rendered the Company good service" (1878).                                                                               D.38/6b, fo. 151; D.38/13, fo. 7

He was probably the son of François Sahys, a Swiss soldier in the de Meurons regiment who came to Red River in 1817 and is listed in the 1849 Red River Census,

aged 70. (E.H. Bovay, Le Canada et les Suisses, 1604-1974, 1976, p. 206; PAM, Red River Census index). The François Sahys of Red River, aged 19, who signed a

contract at Fort Garry in 1841, was probably a brother of Jean Baptiste Sahys. (A.32/52, fo. 46) A François Sahys who was employed in the Cumberland District,

credited with 13 years service in 1882, was presumably a different man. (B.235/g/7)
