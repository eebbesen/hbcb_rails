Reference to Francois Xavier Seguin dit Laderoute was located in the Columbia ledger books and as a post script

in a letter from Peter Skene Ogden         (D.4/119, fo. 34).

"Although land records show him settling on a claim near Fairfield in 1847, he was on the land much earlier,

being one of those married by Jason Lee, the Methodist missionary, in 1838 and frequently mentioned by him.

The marriage was later redone by the Catholic priest. Laderoute's wife was Julie Gervais, daughter of his

neighbour Joseph Gervais. After Julie's death (July 9, 1845), he married Marie Ann Ouvrie in 1847. He had

four recorded children by Julie and eleven by Marie Ann. Through various marriages, the Laderoute name                           ARCHIVES

became entwined with many original Prairie names - Gervais, Malouin, Groslouis, Perrault, Lachapelle".                           WINNIPEG

(Catholic Church Records of the Pacific North West, St. Paul Annotations to Vols. I, II, III, p. 51).

A reference to Joseph P. Seguin dit Laderoute was located in the North West Company ledger (F.4/323) (1812).

He apparently was stationed in the Red River area. No other reference is made to him. Frederick and Olivier

Seguin dit Laderoute were both employed by the Hudson's Bay Company (See biog sheets). Both came from

Sault St. Louis/Lachine area. Joseph may have been the father of Francois, Olivier and perhaps Frederick, based

on the approximate birth dates.
