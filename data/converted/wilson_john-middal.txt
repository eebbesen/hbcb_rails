Married, one child (D.38/48)

According to an article in The House Detective, Oct. 1943, he was featured in a "Ripley's Believe It or Not" column, Oct. 1938,

for "working 54 years without being late or absent. He carried $100,000,000.00 and only lost $2.50".

The article quotes a letter from his daughter, Mrs E.L. Axford, of Furby Street, Winnipeg, dated 26 Aug. 1943, to R.H.G. Bonnycastle.

She thanks him for having attended her father's funeral. She mentions that her four sons had not been able to be present. The rest of the

letter relates some family stories. Johnnie Wilson remembered that once, "alone, with a horse and buckboard he took $15,000 (in small

denominations) treaty money to Selkirk."
