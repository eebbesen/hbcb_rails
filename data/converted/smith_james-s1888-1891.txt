James S. Smith joined the Hudson's Bay Company in 1888 as a labourer in the Island Lake District. Apparently he served in that capacity until

1891.

There is a servant of the Company listed in the Cassiar District in 1892 by the name of James S. Smith but it is not known whether this is the same

man. The following year he became a freeman (ie: a former employee of a fur company who elected to remain in the interior as an independent

trapper or trader or settler).
