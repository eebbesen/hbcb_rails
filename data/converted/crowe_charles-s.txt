*An Outfit year ran from 1 June to 31 May

                        Charles S. Crowe, a Norwegian, entered the Hudson's Bay Company in 1855 when he was 20 or 21 years of age,(1) and

sailed as a cabin passenger in the Company's ship Prince Arthur (Captain Robert Royal) from London to Moose Factory.(2)

                        Charles Crowe was stationed in the Moose Factory District, first as an apprentice clerk and later (from 1860) as a clerk.      He

was transferred to the Albany River District in 1862, and was at Lac Seul at least as early as the beginning of outfit 1868-69 when that post was

transferred from the Company's Albany River District to the Lac La Pluie District.(3)

                        In August 1874 Chief Trader A.R. Lillie, the Officer in charge of Fort Frances, the headquarters of the District, reported:

"C.S. Crowe has for the last four years served under my immediate orders, I have at all times found him very agreeable and energetic in the discharge

of his duty, and most zealous for the good of the concern. He has always been considered officer, and I regret his retirement from the service".(4)

Although Crowe had been appointed, and had received his commission as Junior Chief Trader (dating as from 1 June 873), he left the Company at the

end of July 1874. Apparently, he did not wish to go, as appointed in 1874, to Rapid River post in the Cumberland District, and wished to enter into

business on his own account.(5)

Crowe re-entered the Company and was stationed as a clerk at Fort Frances during season 1876-77.(6) In May 1877 he went to Rat Portage where he

was clerk in charge of the Company's business until the autumn of 1879 when he returned to Fort Frances.(7) Crowe had charge of Fort Frances

which, with the beginning of outfit 1879-80, became a subordinate post to Rat Portage, the new headquarters of the Lac La Plea District.(8)
