Shanagraté appears to have been a non-contracted employee who worked occasionally for the Hudson's Bay Company as gratuities but no wages

were paid to him. The accounts also reveal that Shanagraté traded furs with the company.

                                                                                          (H.B.C.A., B.223/d/105a)
