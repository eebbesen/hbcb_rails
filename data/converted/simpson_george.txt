Said to have 5 years service in 1875 (B.134/g/50) but was not traced in earlier records of the Montreal Department.                There is some

inconsistency about his year of birth.     Two records suggest that he was born around 1861 (B.329/e/3, fo. 11; A.32/53,fo. 83) but another gives

his date of birth as 29 Jan. 1863 (RG3/40A/2). If he was the George Simpson who was the son of Chief Factor John Wedderburn Simpson, his

year of birth would have been around 1857 (Search File, "Simpson, John Wedderburn").

The Pointe Bleue Inspection Report for 1890 described him as "...29 years of age; married, 2 children living with him...a very steady, sober, and

trustworthy man, who can be trusted to attend to the store during the absence of the Officer in charge, in fact, answers the purpose as well as a

Clerk." (B.329/e/3, fo. 11)
